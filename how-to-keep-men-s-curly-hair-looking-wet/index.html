These products are specifically designed to create a slick, wet look that lasts all day.</p><p>When choosing a wet look gel or pomade, look for products that are water-based, rather than oil-based. Water-based products are easier to wash out and won't leave your hair feeling greasy or heavy.</p><p>It's important to note that not all curly hair types are the same.
