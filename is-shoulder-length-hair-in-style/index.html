The answer is yes! Shoulder length hair has been a popular choice for many years and continues to be a trendy and versatile option for both men and women. In this article, we'll explore why shoulder length hair is still in style, how to style it, and how to take care of it.</p><h2>Why Is Shoulder Length Hair In Style?</h2><p>One reason why shoulder length hair is still in style is because it's a flattering length for most face shapes. It's also a versatile length that can be styled in many different ways, from beachy waves to sleek and straight. Shoulder length hair is also easy to maintain and can work for both casual and formal occasions.</p><p>Another reason why shoulder length hair is in style is because of the rise of the "lob" or long bob. The lob is a popular haircut that falls just above the shoulders and is a great option for those who want to try a shorter length without committing to a pixie cut or bob.</p><h2>How To Style Shoulder Length Hair</h2><p>There are many ways to style shoulder length hair, depending on your personal preference and the occasion. Here are a few ideas:</p><h3>Beachy Waves</h3><p>To achieve beachy waves, start by applying a texturizing spray to damp hair. Then, use a curling wand to curl random sections of hair away from your face. Once you've finished curling, use your fingers to tousle your hair and create a relaxed, beachy look.</p><h3>Sleek and Straight</h3><p>To achieve a sleek and straight look, start by blow drying your hair straight with a round brush. Then, use a flat iron to smooth out any remaining kinks or waves. Finish off with a shine serum to add some extra gloss.</p><h3>Messy Bun</h3><p>A messy bun is a great option for those who want to keep their hair out of their face. To achieve this look, pull your hair back into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic. Then, twist the ponytail around the base of the elastic and secure it with bobby pins.</p><h2>Step By Step: How To Cut Shoulder Length Hair</h2><p>If you're considering cutting your hair to shoulder length, here's a step by step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Start With Dry Hair</h3><p>It's best to cut your hair when it's dry, as wet hair can shrink when it dries and result in a shorter length than you intended.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four parts: top, sides, and back. Clip each section out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Begin cutting the back section of your hair first. Use a mirror to check your progress as you go.</p><h3>Step 4: Move Onto The Sides</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the back section, move onto the sides. Use the length of the back section as a guide for the length of the sides.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish With The Top</h3><p>Finally, cut the top section of your hair. Use the sides as a guide for the length.</p><h2>Tips For Taking Care Of Shoulder Length Hair</h2><p>Here are a few tips for taking care of shoulder length hair:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use A Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>When detangling your hair, use a wide-tooth comb to avoid pulling and breaking your hair.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use A Heat Protectant</h3><p>If you're using heat styling tools, be sure to use a heat protectant to avoid damaging your hair.</p><h3>Tip 3: Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>To keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends, it's important to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Is shoulder length hair easy to maintain?</h3><p>A: Yes, shoulder length hair is easy to maintain and doesn't require as much upkeep as longer hair.</p><h3>Q: What face shape does shoulder length hair look best on?</h3><p>A: Shoulder length hair is a flattering length for most face shapes.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear my hair up if it's shoulder length?</h3><p>A: Yes, there are many updo options for shoulder length hair, including buns and braids.</p><h3>Q: Is shoulder length hair appropriate for the workplace?</h3><p>A: Yes, shoulder length hair is appropriate for most workplaces and can be styled in a professional manner.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Shoulder length hair is still in style and is a versatile and flattering length for most people. Whether you prefer beachy waves or sleek and straight, there are many ways to style shoulder length hair. By following a few tips for hair care and maintenance, you can keep your shoulder length hair looking healthy and stylish.</p></article>
