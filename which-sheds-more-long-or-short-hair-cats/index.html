Generally, long hair cats shed more because they have more hair to lose. However, short hair cats can also shed heavily if they have a thick coat.</p><p>Shedding is a natural process that helps cats get rid of old or damaged hair.

Use a cat-specific shampoo and avoid getting water in their ears or eyes.</p><h3>Diet:</h3><p>A healthy diet can help keep your cat's coat in good condition and reduce shedding.
