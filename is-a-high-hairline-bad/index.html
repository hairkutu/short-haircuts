However, there are some variations depending on your gender and ethnicity.</p><h3>Step 2: Check Your Hairline</h3><p>Stand in front of a mirror and use your fingers to gently pull your hair back from your forehead. Take a look at where your hairline starts. Does it form a straight line across your forehead, or does it start farther back?

While hair loss can sometimes cause a high hairline, there are many other factors that can contribute to it, including genetics and hormones.</p><h3>Q: Can a high hairline be treated?</h3><p>A: In some cases, a high hairline can be treated with hair transplant surgery.
