Vacuum at least once a week or more often if you have allergies.</p><h3>2. Use a lint roller</h3><p>Keep a lint roller handy to quickly remove any hair from your clothes and furniture.</p><h3>3. Wash their bedding</h3><p>Make sure to wash your dog's bedding regularly to remove any hair and dander. Use a pet-safe detergent and dry on a low heat setting.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Do these breeds require a lot of exercise?</h3><p>A: It depends on the breed, but most of these breeds require moderate exercise to stay healthy and happy.</p><h3>Q: Do these breeds get along with children?</h3><p>A: Yes, most of these breeds are friendly and get along well with children.
