It's essential to clean your scalp regularly to prevent this buildup. Use a mild shampoo that suits your hair type and wash your hair at least twice a week.</p><h3>Use Essential Oils</h3><p>Essential oils such as tea tree oil, lavender oil, and peppermint oil have anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties that can help soothe an itchy scalp and promote hair growth.

Leave it on for an hour and then wash your hair.</p><h3>Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>Your diet plays a significant role in maintaining healthy hair and scalp. Eat a balanced diet that includes protein, vitamins, and minerals. Foods such as eggs, fish, leafy greens, nuts, and seeds are rich in these nutrients and can promote hair growth and scalp health.</p><h3>Try Home Remedies</h3><p>Home remedies such as aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, and baking soda can help soothe an itchy scalp and promote hair growth.
