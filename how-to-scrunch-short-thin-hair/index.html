Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type. Avoid using heavy conditioners that can weigh down your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Hair Product</h3><p>Apply a hair product, such as a mousse or gel, to your damp hair. Start with a small amount and add more if needed. Work the product through your hair, focusing on the roots and mid-lengths.</p><h3>Step 3: Scrunch Your Hair</h3><p>Flip your head upside-down and scrunch your hair with your hands. Do this gently to avoid creating frizz. Scrunch your hair for a few minutes until it is evenly distributed.</p><h3>Step 4: Dry Your Hair with a Diffuser</h3><p>Attach a diffuser to your hair dryer and dry your hair on a low heat setting.
