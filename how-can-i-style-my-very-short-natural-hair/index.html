It can be a challenge to style, but there are many ways to make it look great. Whether you want a sleek and polished look or a more textured and edgy style, there are options for you. <h2 id="how-to">How to Style Very Short Natural Hair</h2> There are many different ways to style very short natural hair. Here are a few options: <b>1. The Tapered Cut:</b> A tapered cut is a great option for those who want a low-maintenance style. It involves cutting the hair shorter at the sides and back and leaving a little more length on top. This creates a gradual transition from short to long hair, which looks great on natural hair. <b>2. The Twist Out:</b> A twist out is a popular style for natural hair of all lengths. To achieve this style on very short hair, simply twist small sections of hair and allow them to dry. Once your hair is dry, unravel the twists and fluff your hair to create volume and definition. <b>3. The Finger Coils:</b> Finger coils are another great option for very short natural hair. This style involves coiling small sections of hair around your finger to create defined curls. This style can last for several days with the right hair care. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><b>1. The Tapered Cut:</b><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair.</li><li>Blow dry your hair, using a comb to create a smooth finish.</li><li>Cut the sides and back of your hair shorter than the top.</li><li>Style the top of your hair as desired.</li></ol><b>2.
