Neutral skin tones can pull off both warm and cool tones.</p><h3 id="step2">Step 2: Consider Your Eye Colour</h3><p>Your eye colour can also play a role in determining which hair colour suits you best. If you have warm-toned eyes like brown or hazel, warm hair colours like caramel and honey blonde would look great on you. If you have cool-toned eyes like blue or green, cool shades like ash brown and platinum blonde would complement your eyes.</p><h3 id="step3">Step 3: Think About Your Natural Hair Colour</h3><p>If you're not looking for a drastic change, consider your natural hair colour when choosing a new shade. Staying within a few shades of your natural hair colour can make the transition easier and look more natural.</p><h3 id="step4">Step 4: Take Inspiration from Your Favourite Celebrities</h3><p>Looking at your favourite celebrities who have similar skin tones and eye colours to you can give you inspiration for your new hair colour.
