Use a pair of clippers or scissors to trim your hair to about 1/4 inch.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Shaving Cream or Gel</h3><p>Apply shaving cream or gel to the back and sides of your head. Massage it into your scalp to create a lather. This will help lubricate your skin and reduce the risk of razor burn.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Shaving</h3><p>Start shaving the back of your head first. Use long, smooth strokes and be careful not to press too hard. Rinse your razor frequently to prevent clogging. Once you've finished the back of your head, move on to the sides. Use your mirror to help guide you.</p><h3>Step 4: Rinse and Repeat</h3><p>Once you've finished shaving, rinse your head with warm water.
