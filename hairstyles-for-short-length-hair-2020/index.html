Here are some things to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Face shape:</strong> Different short hairstyles will flatter different face shapes. For example, a pixie cut or bob can look great on oval or heart-shaped faces, while a chin-length cut or shaggy bob may be better for square or round faces.</li><li><strong>Hair texture:</strong> Some short hairstyles require more maintenance than others, depending on your hair texture. If you have fine, straight hair, a blunt bob may work well. If you have curly hair, a layered cut may help you avoid the dreaded triangle shape.</li><li><strong>Personal style:</strong> Your personality and lifestyle should also play a role in your hairstyle choice. Are you low-maintenance and sporty? A messy pixie cut may be perfect for you. Do you like to experiment with different looks? A bold, asymmetrical bob could be just the thing.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the best way to choose a short hairstyle is to talk to your stylist.
