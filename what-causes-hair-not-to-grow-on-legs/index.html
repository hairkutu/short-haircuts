In fact, there are many factors that can contribute to hair not growing on legs. This can be frustrating, especially if you want to wear shorts, dresses or skirts without feeling self-conscious. Some of the things that cause hair not to grow on legs include genetics, hormonal imbalances, lack of proper nutrition, and skin irritation. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Encourage Hair Growth on Legs</h2><p>If you are looking to encourage hair growth on your legs, there are a few things that you can do:</p><h3>1. Improve Your Diet</h3><p>One of the most important things that you can do for hair growth on your legs is to improve your diet.

You may also want to consider waxing or using hair removal creams, which can be less irritating to the skin.</p><h3>3. Keep Your Skin Moisturized</h3><p>Dry skin can also contribute to hair not growing on legs.
