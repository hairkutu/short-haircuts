First, look for a shampoo that is formulated specifically for fine hair. These shampoos are designed to add volume and thickness to hair without weighing it down. They often contain ingredients like biotin, keratin, and panthenol that can help strengthen hair and prevent breakage.</p><p>Second, look for a shampoo that is free from harsh chemicals. Sulfates, for example, can strip hair of its natural oils and leave it dry and brittle. Look for shampoos that are sulfate-free and contain gentle, nourishing ingredients like argan oil or coconut oil.</p><p>Finally, consider your specific hair needs. If you have a sensitive scalp, look for a shampoo that is fragrance-free and gentle. If you have colour-treated hair, look for a shampoo that is designed to protect and preserve your colour.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Using Shampoo</h2><p>Using the right technique to wash your hair can make a big difference in how it looks and feels.
