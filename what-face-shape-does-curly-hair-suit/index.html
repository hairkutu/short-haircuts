Oval faces are considered to be the most versatile face shape when it comes to hairstyles. With curly hair, you can play up your natural texture by wearing your hair in loose waves or defined curls. You can also experiment with different hair lengths, from short bobs to long layers. The key is to avoid adding too much volume to your hair, as this can make your face look longer.</p><h2 id="round-face">Round Face</h2><p>If you have a round face, you'll want to create the illusion of length and definition. To do this, opt for hairstyles that add height at the crown of your head, such as a curly updo or a half-up, half-down style. You can also try side-swept bangs or layers that frame your face. Avoid hairstyles that add volume to the sides of your head, as this can make your face look wider.</p><h2 id="square-face">Square Face</h2><p>If you have a square-shaped face, you'll want to soften your features with curly hair. Try wearing your hair in loose waves or a curly bob that falls just below your chin. You can also experiment with side-swept bangs or a middle part, which can help to break up the symmetry of your face. Avoid hairstyles with blunt edges or straight lines, as this can emphasize your square jawline.</p><h2 id="heart-face">Heart Face</h2><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, you'll want to create balance by adding volume to the lower half of your face. To do this, opt for hairstyles with curls or waves that start at your chin or below. You can also try a side part with face-framing layers or bangs. Avoid hairstyles that add volume to the top of your head, as this can make your forehead look wider.</p><h2 id="diamond-face">Diamond Face</h2><p>If you have a diamond-shaped face, you'll want to create the illusion of width at the forehead and chin. To do this, opt for hairstyles with volume at the crown of your head, such as a curly ponytail or an updo with loose curls. You can also try side-swept bangs or a middle part with face-framing layers. Avoid hairstyles that add volume at the sides of your head, as this can make your face look narrower.</p><h2 id="triangular-face">Triangular Face</h2><p>If you have a triangular-shaped face, you'll want to create balance by adding volume to the upper half of your face. To do this, opt for hairstyles with volume at the crown of your head, such as a curly half-up, half-down style or a curly updo. You can also try side-swept bangs or layers that frame your face. Avoid hairstyles that add volume to the lower half of your face, as this can make your chin look more prominent.</p><h2 id="how-to-style">How to Style Curly Hair for Your Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know which hairstyles suit your face shape, it's time to learn how to style your curly hair to flatter your features.
