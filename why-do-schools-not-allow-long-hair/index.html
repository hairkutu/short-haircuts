School is a place for learning and development, and students are expected to present themselves in a way that reflects that. Long hair can be distracting, unkempt, and may even obstruct a student's vision, which can be dangerous in certain situations. Additionally, long hair can be a hygiene issue, especially for younger students who may not have the skills or motivation to maintain their hair properly.</p><p>Another reason why schools do not allow long hair is to promote gender neutrality.

By prohibiting long hair for both genders, schools are promoting a more inclusive and gender-neutral environment, where all students are treated equally.</p><p>Finally, schools may not allow long hair to comply with cultural or religious norms.
