Here are some tips and tricks to fix your curly hair:</p><h3>Towel Dry Gently</h3><p>Firstly, towel dry your hair gently. Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to blot out the excess water. Do not rub your hair vigorously with a regular towel as this can cause frizz and breakage.</p><h3>Apply a Leave-in Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair while it is still damp. This will help to hydrate and detangle your curls. Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Use a Diffuser</h3><p>Instead of blow-drying your hair with a regular hairdryer, use a diffuser attachment. This will help to distribute the heat more evenly and reduce frizz. Use a low heat setting and scrunch your hair with the diffuser to enhance your curls.</p><h3>Refresh Your Curls with a Curl Refresher</h3><p>If your curls start to lose their shape during the day, use a curl refresher to revive them.
