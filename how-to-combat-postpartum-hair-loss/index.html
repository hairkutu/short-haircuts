Avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair and limit the use of heat styling tools. Additionally, avoid tight hairstyles that can pull on your hair and cause damage.</p><h3>2. Maintain a Healthy Diet</h3><p>A healthy diet is crucial for healthy hair growth. Make sure to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and processed foods as they can lead to inflammation that can affect hair growth.</p><h3>3.
