However, before you book an appointment, you may be wondering how much a curly perm costs for long hair. In this article, we’ll break down the cost of a curly perm, as well as provide some tips for caring for your new curls.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A curly perm is a chemical treatment that helps add curls to your hair. The process involves wrapping your hair around perm rods and applying a chemical solution that breaks down the bonds in your hair. Once the bonds are broken down, the hair is rinsed, neutralized, and styled into curls that last for several months.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you’re considering getting a curly perm for your long hair, here are the steps that you can expect during the process:</p><h3>Step 1: Consultation</h3><p>The first step in getting a curly perm is to schedule a consultation with a stylist. During the consultation, you should discuss your hair goals, as well as any concerns you may have about the process. Your stylist will also evaluate your hair to determine if it’s a good candidate for a perm.</p><h3>Step 2: Prepping Your Hair</h3><p>Before the perm solution is applied, your stylist will wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup. They will then apply a protective solution to your hairline and ears to prevent any chemical burns.</p><h3>Step 3: Applying the Perm Solution</h3><p>Your stylist will then apply the perm solution to your hair, starting at the ends and working their way up. They will then wrap your hair around perm rods and secure them in place.</p><h3>Step 4: Rinsing and Neutralizing</h3><p>After the perm solution has processed, your stylist will rinse your hair thoroughly to remove any residue. They will then apply a neutralizing solution to your hair to halt the perming process and set the curls.</p><h3>Step 5: Styling</h3><p>Once the neutralizer has processed, your stylist will remove the perm rods and style your hair into your desired look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>After getting a curly perm for your long hair, it’s important to take proper care of your new curls. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid heat styling your hair, as it can damage the curls and cause them to lose their shape.</li><li>Consider using a curl-enhancing product to help define your curls and keep them looking bouncy and healthy.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How much does a curly perm cost for long hair?</h3><p>The cost of a curly perm for long hair can vary depending on several factors, such as your location, the salon you choose, and the experience level of your stylist. On average, you can expect to pay between $100 and $250 for a curly perm for long hair.</p><h3>How long does a curly perm last?</h3><p>A curly perm can last for several months, typically between 3 and 6 months. However, the longevity of your perm will depend on how well you take care of your curls, as well as how quickly your hair grows.</p><h3>Can you get a curly perm on relaxed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can get a curly perm on relaxed hair. However, it’s important to note that the chemical processes involved in both treatments can be damaging to your hair. It’s best to consult with a stylist to determine if a curly perm is a good choice for your hair type and texture.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Getting a curly perm for your long hair can be a fun and exciting way to switch up your look. However, it’s important to take proper care of your new curls to keep them looking healthy and bouncy. By using the right products and avoiding heat styling, you can enjoy your new curls for months to come.</p></article>
