Here's what you'll need:</p><ul><li>Scissors: Make sure you have a pair of sharp, professional-grade hair-cutting scissors. Don't use regular scissors, as they can damage the hair.</li><li>Clippers: Clippers are useful for cutting hair short, especially around the sides and back of the head.</li><li>Comb: A good quality comb will help you section the hair and keep it in place while you cut.</li><li>Cape: A cape will protect the person's clothes from getting hair all over them.</li><li>Spray bottle: A spray bottle filled with water will help you keep the hair damp and easier to cut.</li></ul><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step</h3><p>Now that you have all the necessary tools and equipment, let's get started with the step-by-step process of cutting someone else's hair at home:</p><ol><li>Start by washing the person's hair and towel-drying it.

Make sure to use the appropriate clipper guards to achieve the desired length.</li><li>Blend the hair by using your scissors to cut the hair at an angle. This will create a natural-looking gradient and avoid any harsh lines.</li><li>Use your comb to check for any uneven parts and trim them as necessary.</li><li>Finish by blow-drying the hair and styling it as desired.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>Cutting someone else's hair at home can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you can achieve great results:</p><ul><li>Take your time and be patient.
