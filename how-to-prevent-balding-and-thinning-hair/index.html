Condition your hair:</strong> Conditioning your hair helps to prevent breakage and adds moisture to your hair.</p><p><strong>5. Avoid heat styling:</strong> Heat styling tools such as flat irons and curling irons can cause damage to your hair.

If you're experiencing hair loss and are taking medication, talk to your doctor to see if there's an alternative medication you can take.</p><h2 id="supplements">Supplements</h2><p>There are supplements that can promote healthy hair growth. Here are some supplements to consider:</p><p><strong>1. Biotin:</strong> Biotin is a B-vitamin that promotes hair growth. It's found in foods such as eggs, almonds, and sweet potatoes.
