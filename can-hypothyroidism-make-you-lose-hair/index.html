The thyroid gland is located in the neck and produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism, growth, and development.

Your healthcare provider can help you manage your hypothyroidism and provide recommendations for preventing hair loss.</li><li>Eat a balanced diet. A diet rich in nutrients, including protein, iron, and vitamins, can help promote hair growth.</li><li>Manage stress. Stress can contribute to hair loss, so it is important to manage stress through exercise, meditation, or other relaxation techniques.</li><li>Avoid harsh hair treatments. Chemicals and heat can damage hair and contribute to hair loss. Avoid harsh hair treatments, including coloring, perming, and straightening.</li><li>Use gentle hair care products. Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners that are designed for dry, damaged hair.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Hair Care with Hypothyroidism</h2><p>If you have hypothyroidism, it is important to take extra care of your hair. Here are some tips for hair care with hypothyroidism:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing wet hair. Wet hair is more prone to breakage, so avoid brushing wet hair.</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles. Tight hairstyles, including braids, buns, and ponytails, can pull on the hair and contribute to hair loss.</li><li>Avoid excessive heat. Excessive heat from blow dryers, curling irons, and flat irons can damage hair and contribute to hair loss.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb. A wide-toothed comb can help detangle hair without causing breakage.</li><li>Avoid over-shampooing. Over-shampooing can strip hair of its natural oils and contribute to dry, brittle hair.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Will treating hypothyroidism prevent hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, treating hypothyroidism can prevent hair loss.
