A narrow face is typically characterized by a forehead, cheekbones, and jawline that are all roughly the same width. People with narrow faces also tend to have a high forehead and a pointed chin.</p><p>If you're still not sure if you have a narrow face, try standing in front of a mirror and measuring your face. Use a tape measure to measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. If they're all roughly the same width, then you have a narrow face.</p><h2 id="bestcut">Best Haircut for Narrow Face Male</h2><p>The best haircut for narrow face male is one that adds volume and width to the face. Here are some of the best haircuts to consider:</p><h3>1. Side Part Hairstyle</h3><p>The side part hairstyle is a classic look that works well for narrow face male. This style involves parting your hair on one side and combing it over to the other side. This adds volume to one side of the face, making it appear wider.</p><h3>2. Quiff Hairstyle</h3><p>The quiff hairstyle is another great option for narrow face male. This style involves sweeping the hair up and back, creating height and volume on top of the head. This helps to balance out the narrowness of the face.</p><h3>3. Textured Crop Hairstyle</h3><p>The textured crop hairstyle is a modern and trendy look that works well for narrow face male. This style involves cutting the hair short on the sides and back, while leaving it longer on top. The hair on top is then styled with a textured, messy look, which adds volume and width to the face.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step by Step Guide to Achieving the Best Haircut</h2><p>Now that you know which haircuts work best for narrow face male, let's take a look at how to achieve them.</p><h3>1.
