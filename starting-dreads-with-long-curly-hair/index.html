Dreadlocks are a popular hairstyle choice, and for good reason - they look great, they're low maintenance, and they're a great way to express yourself. However, starting dreads with long curly hair can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely doable. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about starting dreads with long curly hair, from how to do it to hair care tips. </p><h2> How to Start Dreadlocks with Long Curly Hair </h2><p> Before we get into the nitty-gritty of starting dreads with long curly hair, it's important to note that there are different ways to start dreadlocks. Some people prefer to start with the "neglect" method, which involves simply letting your hair grow and form knots naturally over time. Others prefer to use a more intentional method, such as the "twist and rip" method or the "backcombing" method. </p><p> Regardless of which method you choose, there are a few things you should keep in mind when starting dreads with long curly hair. Firstly, you'll need to make sure that your hair is clean and free of any product buildup. This will help your hair lock up more easily. Secondly, you'll want to make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin. </p><h3> The Neglect Method </h3><p> If you're someone who wants to start dreads with the "neglect" method, the process is pretty simple. All you have to do is stop brushing or combing your hair and let it do its thing. Over time, your hair will begin to knot up and form dreadlocks. This method is great for people who want a more natural look and don't mind waiting a bit longer for their dreads to form. </p><h3> The Twist and Rip Method </h3><p> The "twist and rip" method is a popular method for starting dreadlocks, and it's especially great for people with long curly hair. To start, you'll need to section your hair into small sections and twist each section until it begins to knot up. Then, you'll rip the section apart, which will create a knot. Repeat this process throughout your hair until you have the desired number of dreadlocks. </p><h3> The Backcombing Method </h3><p> The "backcombing" method is another popular method for starting dreadlocks, and it involves using a comb to tease your hair back towards your scalp. This creates knots and tangles in your hair, which will eventually form dreadlocks. This method can take a bit longer than other methods, but it can result in more tightly formed dreadlocks. </p><h2> Tips for Starting Dreads with Long Curly Hair </h2><p> Starting dreadlocks with long curly hair can be a bit more challenging than starting dreads with straight hair. However, there are a few tips that can make the process easier for you. Here are some tips to keep in mind: </p><ul><li> Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start </li><li> Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup </li><li> Section your hair into small sections to ensure that each dread is uniform </li><li> Use a crochet hook or your fingers to help your hair lock up </li><li> Be patient - dreads take time to form </li></ul><h2> FAQ: Starting Dreads with Long Curly Hair </h2><h3> Can you start dreads with long curly hair? </h3><p> Yes, you can start dreads with long curly hair. However, it may take a bit longer for your hair to lock up than it would with straight hair. </p><h3> What's the best method for starting dreads with long curly hair? </h3><p> The best method for starting dreads with long curly hair depends on your personal preference. Some people prefer the "neglect" method, while others prefer the "twist and rip" method or the "backcombing" method. </p><h3> Will starting dreads with long curly hair damage my hair? </h3><p> Starting dreads with long curly hair shouldn't damage your hair as long as you take care of your hair and avoid using any harsh chemicals or products. </p><h2> Hair Care Tips for Dreadlocks </h2><p> Once you've started your dreadlocks, it's important to take care of them properly. Here are some hair care tips to keep in mind: </p><ul><li> Wash your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo </li><li> Avoid using any products that contain wax or petroleum </li><li> Use a crochet hook or your fingers to help tighten up loose hairs </li><li> Be gentle when washing and drying your hair </li><li> Cover your hair when you sleep to prevent frizz </li></ul><h2> Conclusion </h2><p> Starting dreadlocks with long curly hair may seem daunting, but it's definitely doable. Whether you choose the "neglect" method, the "twist and rip" method, or the "backcombing" method, the key is to be patient and take care of your hair. With the right care and maintenance, your dreadlocks will look great and last for years to come. </p></article>
