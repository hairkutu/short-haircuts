If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle with frizzy hair, especially when they brush it. But what causes this frizz, and what can you do about it?</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Frizzy hair can be caused by a number of factors, including humidity, heat, and damage from styling tools. When you brush your hair, you can also create friction, which can lead to frizz. Frizz occurs when the outer layer of your hair, known as the cuticle, becomes damaged or lifted.</p><h2>How to Prevent Frizzy Hair When Brushing</h2><p>There are several things you can do to prevent frizzy hair when brushing:</p><h3>Step 1: Use the Right Brush</h3><p>Using the wrong brush can cause more damage to your hair and create more frizz. Use a brush with natural bristles, such as boar bristle brushes, as they are gentler on your hair and can help distribute natural oils throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Brush Your Hair When it's Dry</h3><p>Brushing wet hair can cause more damage and frizz. Wait until your hair is completely dry before brushing it.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Applying a leave-in conditioner can help keep your hair moisturized and prevent frizz. Apply a small amount to the ends of your hair before brushing.</p><h3>Step 4: Brush Properly</h3><p>Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots. Be gentle and avoid pulling or tugging on your hair.</p><h2>Tips to Prevent Frizzy Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to prevent frizzy hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid using hot styling tools, such as curling irons and straighteners, as they can damage your hair and cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid using harsh hair products that contain alcohol, as they can dry out your hair and cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid using a towel to dry your hair, as the friction can cause frizz. Instead, use a microfiber towel or a cotton t-shirt to gently blot your hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Why is my hair frizzy when I brush it?</h3><p>Frizzy hair can be caused by a number of factors, including humidity, heat, and damage from styling tools.
