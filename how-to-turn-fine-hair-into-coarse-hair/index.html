This will help add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li><strong>Blow dry your hair upside down.</strong> Flip your head upside down and blow dry your hair, using your fingers to lift and separate the strands. This will create even more volume and texture.</li><li><strong>Use a curling iron or wand.</strong> Use a curling iron or wand to create loose waves or curls throughout your hair. This will add even more texture and thickness.</li><li><strong>Use a sea salt spray.</strong> Spray a sea salt spray throughout your hair to add even more texture and give your hair a beachy, tousled look.</li><li><strong>Consider a perm or chemical treatment.</strong> If you're looking for a more permanent solution, consider getting a perm or chemical treatment. These treatments can make your hair permanently thicker and rougher.</li></ol><p>Keep in mind that these steps may not work for everyone. Your hair type, texture, and overall health can all impact the results.
