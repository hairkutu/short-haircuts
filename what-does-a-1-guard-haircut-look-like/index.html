But what does it mean, and how does it look like? In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about a 1 guard haircut, including its description, how-to, step-by-step guide, tips, frequently asked questions, and hair care tips.</p><h2>Description: What is a 1 Guard Haircut?</h2><p>A 1 guard haircut is a type of haircut that uses a clipper guard with the number 1 attachment. The clipper guard is a plastic attachment that fits over the clipper blades, which determines the length of the hair that will be cut. The number 1 guard is equivalent to 1/8 of an inch or 3mm, which means that the haircut will leave hair that is about 1/8 of an inch long.</p><p>The 1 guard haircut is also known as a buzz cut or an induction cut. It is a popular haircut for men who want a low-maintenance and easy-to-maintain hairstyle. The 1 guard haircut is also a popular choice for military personnel, athletes, and people who work in professions that require short haircuts.</p><h2>How to Get a 1 Guard Haircut: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Getting a 1 guard haircut is relatively easy and can be done at home or by a professional barber.
