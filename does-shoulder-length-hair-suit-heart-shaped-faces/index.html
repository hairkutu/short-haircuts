In this article, we'll explore the question, "does shoulder length hair suit heart shaped faces?" and provide tips to help you make the best decision for your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A heart-shaped face is characterized by a broader forehead and narrower chin, often with high cheekbones. Many celebrities, such as Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, have heart-shaped faces. If you have this face shape, you may be looking for a hairstyle that balances your features and highlights your best assets.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>When it comes to choosing a hairstyle for heart-shaped faces, there are a few key things to consider.
