This can be challenging for women who want to rock a trendy hairstyle while still looking youthful. If you have a round face and are over 60, you might be wondering what short hairstyles will work for you. In this article, we will explore some of the best short hairstyles for over 60 round face and provide you with tips on how to take care of your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face is characterized by a wide forehead, round cheeks, and a soft jawline. Women with round faces often struggle to find hairstyles that complement their features. However, there are plenty of short hairstyles that can work for women with round faces. The key is to choose a hairstyle that adds height and volume to your hair while also elongating your face.</p><h2>How to Choose a Short Hairstyle for Over 60 Round Face</h2><p>When choosing a short hairstyle for over 60 round face, there are a few things you should keep in mind:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, women with round faces should choose hairstyles that elongate their face. This can be achieved by adding height and volume to the top of your head. You should avoid hairstyles that add width to your face, such as blunt bangs or chin-length bobs.</p><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture will also play a role in the type of hairstyle you should choose. If you have thin hair, you might want to consider a layered bob or a pixie cut. If you have thick hair, a short shag or a layered crop might work better for you.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Your lifestyle should also be taken into consideration when choosing a short hairstyle. If you are someone who is always on the go and doesn't have a lot of time to style your hair, a low-maintenance pixie cut might be perfect for you.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling Short Hairstyles for Over 60 Round Face</h2><p>Once you have chosen a short hairstyle for over 60 round face, here are some tips on how to style it:</p><h3>Wash and Condition</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body to your hair.</p><h3>Towel Dry</h3><p>Gently towel dry your hair to remove excess water. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel as this can cause breakage.</p><h3>Apply Styling Products</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair to add texture and hold. This could be a mousse, gel, or wax, depending on your hair type.</p><h3>Blow Dry</h3><p>Use a blow dryer to dry your hair while using a round brush to add volume. Start at the roots and work your way up to the ends.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, style it using a flat iron or curling iron. Use a hairspray to set your style in place.</p><h2>Tips for Caring for Short Hairstyles for Over 60 Round Face</h2><p>Here are some tips for caring for your short hairstyle:</p><h3>Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Short hairstyles require regular trims to maintain their shape. You should visit your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim.</p><h3>Use Heat Protectant</h3><p>If you use heat styling tools on your hair, make sure to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage.</p><h3>Avoid Over-Washing</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, making it dry and brittle. Try to wash your hair every other day or every three days.</p><h3>Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Once a week, use a deep conditioning treatment to nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What are the best short hairstyles for over 60 round face?</h3><p>The best short hairstyles for over 60 round face include layered bobs, pixie cuts, and short shags.</p><h3>How often should I trim my short hair?</h3><p>You should visit your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim.</p><h3>What products should I use on my short hair?</h3><p>You should use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, a styling product such as mousse, gel, or wax, and a hairspray to set your style in place.</p><h2>Hair Care Products for Short Hairstyles for Over 60 Round Face</h2><p>Here are some hair care products that are perfect for short hairstyles for over 60 round face:</p><ul><li>Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner</li><li>Styling Product (Mousse, Gel, or Wax)</li><li>Hairspray</li><li>Heat Protectant Spray</li><li>Deep Conditioning Treatment</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Short hairstyles for over 60 round face can be flattering and easy to maintain with the right care and styling products.
