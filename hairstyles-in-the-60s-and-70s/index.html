From the bouffant to the afro, there was no shortage of unique and iconic hairstyles that defined the era. In this blog post, we will dive into the most popular hairstyles of the 60s and 70s, how to recreate them, tips to perfect your look, and FAQ's to help you achieve the perfect retro hairdo.

Here are some of the most popular hairstyles of the era:</p><h3>The Bouffant</h3><p>The bouffant was a popular hairstyle in the 60s, characterized by a large, puffy style that was often teased and styled with hairspray. To achieve this look, start by backcombing the top section of your hair to create volume. Then, smooth the top layer of your hair over the backcombed section, and secure with bobby pins. Finish with a generous amount of hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>The Beehive</h3><p>The beehive was another iconic hairstyle of the 60s, characterized by a high, dome-shaped style that was often accessorized with hairpins and ribbons. To achieve this look, start by backcombing the top section of your hair to create height. Then, smooth the top layer of your hair over the backcombed section, and secure with bobby pins. Finish with a decorative hairpin or ribbon to add a touch of glamour.</p><h3>The Afro</h3><p>The afro was a popular hairstyle in the 70s, characterized by a large, rounded style that was often worn by African Americans as a symbol of black pride. To achieve this look, start by washing and conditioning your hair to create volume. Then, use a wide-tooth comb to gently tease your hair outwards, creating a rounded shape.
