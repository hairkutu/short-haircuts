Once you know what's causing it, you can take the necessary steps to prevent it. Here are some ways to reduce hair fall:</p><h3>Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>A healthy diet is essential for healthy hair growth. Make sure you're getting enough protein, iron, and vitamins such as biotin, zinc, and vitamin D.
