The grades are determined by the processing that the hair goes through, as well as the origin of the hair. </p><ul><li> Non-Remy hair: This is the lowest quality of human hair. It is collected from the floor of hair salons, temples, and other locations, and the cuticles are often stripped. Non-Remy hair is chemically treated to make it look smoother and shinier. </li><li> Remy hair: This is a higher quality of human hair. It is collected from a single donor, and the cuticles are kept intact. Remy hair is not chemically treated, so it looks more natural and can be styled more easily. </li><li> Virgin hair: This is the highest quality of human hair. It is collected from a single donor, and the cuticles are kept intact. The hair is not chemically treated or processed in any way, so it looks and feels completely natural. </li></ul><h3 id="best"> What is the Best Grade of Human Hair to Buy? </h3><p> The best grade of human hair to buy depends on your needs and budget. If you're looking for the highest quality and most natural-looking hair, virgin hair is the way to go. However, it is also the most expensive grade of human hair.
