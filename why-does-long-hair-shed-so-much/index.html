Shedding is a natural process where old hair falls out to make room for new growth. However, when shedding becomes excessive, it can lead to thinning hair and balding spots, which is why so many people wonder why does long hair shed so much.</p><p>Shedding can be caused by a variety of factors, such as genetics, stress, poor diet, hormonal changes, and certain medications. However, for many people, the primary cause of excessive shedding is improper hair care.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Reduce Shedding</h2><p>If you're tired of dealing with excessive shedding, there are several things you can do to reduce hair loss:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, starting at the ends and working your way up to the roots. Avoid using a brush, which can pull and break your hair.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools such as flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers, which can damage your hair and cause it to break and shed.</li><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, and avoid products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates.</li><li>Eat a balanced diet with plenty of protein, vitamins, and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li><li>Reduce stress through exercise, meditation, or other relaxation techniques.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to reducing shedding:</p><ol><li>Start by detangling your hair with a wide-tooth comb.</li><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, and rinse thoroughly.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to your damp hair to help prevent breakage and shedding.</li><li>Allow your hair to air dry, or use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair on a low setting.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools as much as possible, and use a heat protectant spray if you must use them.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips to Prevent Shedding</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to prevent shedding:</p><ul><li>Avoid wearing tight hairstyles such as braids, ponytails, and buns, as these can pull and break your hair.</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent friction and breakage while you sleep.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils and lead to dryness and breakage.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends, which can lead to breakage and shedding.</li><li>Avoid using hair products that contain alcohol, as this can dry out your hair and cause it to break and shed.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: How much shedding is normal?</h3><p>A: It's normal to shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day. However, if you're shedding more than that, you may have a problem with excessive shedding.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can cause hair shedding. When you're stressed, your body produces a hormone called cortisol, which can disrupt the normal hair growth cycle and cause excessive shedding.</p><h3>Q: Can medication cause hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, certain medications can cause hair shedding as a side effect. If you're experiencing excessive shedding and are taking medication, talk to your doctor to see if that could be the cause.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Long Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for caring for long hair:</p><ul><li>Brush your hair gently with a boar bristle brush to distribute your hair's natural oils and promote shine.</li><li>Avoid using hair elastics with metal parts, as these can snag and break your hair. Instead, use a hair tie that's made of soft, stretchy material.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair with hot water, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils and lead to dryness and breakage.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li></ul><p>If you're still experiencing excessive shedding despite following these tips, it may be time to see a dermatologist or hair specialist to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p></article>
