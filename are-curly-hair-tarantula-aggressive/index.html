They are a medium-sized tarantula, growing up to 5 inches in legspan, and are considered to be one of the more docile species of tarantula.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Identify Curly Hair Tarantula</h2><p>Curly hair tarantulas have distinctive features that make them easy to identify. Here are some of the key features:</p><ul><li>Thick, curly hair covering their entire body</li><li>Dark brown or black body with lighter hairs on their legs and abdomen</li><li>Medium-sized, growing up to 5 inches in legspan</li><li>Eight legs and two pedipalps (used for sensing and mating)</li></ul><p>If you are unsure whether you have a curly hair tarantula or not, it is best to consult with a professional or experienced tarantula keeper.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Taking Care of Curly Hair Tarantula</h2><p>Curly hair tarantulas are relatively easy to care for, but it is important to provide them with the right environment and food to keep them healthy. Here is a step by step guide to taking care of your curly hair tarantula:</p><ol><li>Set up a terrarium: Curly hair tarantulas require a terrarium that is at least 10 gallons in size. The terrarium should be filled with substrate (such as coconut fiber or peat moss) to a depth of at least 3 inches. It is important to provide your tarantula with a hiding place, such as a half-log or piece of bark.</li><li>Provide the right temperature and humidity: Curly hair tarantulas prefer a temperature range of 75-85°F and a humidity level of 60-70%. You can use a heat lamp or under-tank heating pad to maintain the right temperature, and mist the enclosure regularly to maintain humidity.</li><li>Feed your tarantula: Curly hair tarantulas are carnivorous and primarily eat insects such as crickets, mealworms, and roaches. Feed your tarantula 1-2 times a week, and make sure to remove any uneaten prey after 24 hours.</li><li>Handle with care: While curly hair tarantulas are generally docile, it is important to handle them with care. Always approach your tarantula slowly and gently, and avoid handling them when they are in pre-molt or post-molt.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Taking Care of Curly Hair Tarantula</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for taking care of your curly hair tarantula:</p><ul><li>Provide a water dish: Curly hair tarantulas require access to fresh water at all times. Provide a shallow water dish in their enclosure, and make sure to change the water regularly.</li><li>Use a substrate that retains moisture: Curly hair tarantulas require a substrate that retains moisture to maintain humidity. Coconut fiber or peat moss are good choices.</li><li>Avoid overcrowding: Curly hair tarantulas are solitary creatures and do not do well in groups. Keep one tarantula per enclosure.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Are curly hair tarantulas aggressive?</h3><p>No, curly hair tarantulas are not considered to be aggressive. They are generally docile and easy to handle.</p><h3>Do curly hair tarantulas bite?</h3><p>Like all tarantulas, curly hair tarantulas have the ability to bite. However, they are not aggressive and will usually only bite if they feel threatened or provoked.</p><h3>What should I do if my curly hair tarantula bites me?</h3><p>If your curly hair tarantula bites you, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. While their venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans, some people may have an allergic reaction.</p><h3>How often should I feed my curly hair tarantula?</h3><p>Curly hair tarantulas should be fed 1-2 times a week. Make sure to remove any uneaten prey after 24 hours.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Curly Hair Tarantula Hair Care</h2><p>While curly hair tarantulas do not require any specific hair care, it is important to keep their environment clean and free of debris.
