To use mousse on curly hair, start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are specifically formulated for curly hair. Towel dry your hair gently, being careful not to rub it too hard or cause frizz.</p><p>Next, apply a golf ball-sized amount of mousse to your hands and work it through your hair, starting at the roots and working your way down to the ends. Be sure to distribute the mousse evenly throughout your hair, and avoid applying too much to any one section, as this can cause your hair to become weighed down and flat.</p><p>Once you've applied the mousse, you can either let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your curls gently. When your hair is completely dry, you can style it as desired, using your fingers to separate and define your curls.</p><h2 id="best-mousse">Best Mousse to Hold Curly Hair</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the best mousse to hold curly hair, there are many options available, each with its own unique benefits and features.
