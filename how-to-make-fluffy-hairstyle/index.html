Here are the steps you need to follow to achieve this look:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>The first step to creating a fluffy hairstyle is to wash and condition your hair. Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add some extra bounce to your locks. Rinse thoroughly and towel dry your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Mousse or Texturizing Spray</h3><p>Apply a small amount of mousse or texturizing spray to your hair. This will help to add some texture and hold to your locks. Distribute the product evenly throughout your hair, using your fingers or a comb.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a round brush, blow dry your hair in sections. Start from the bottom and work your way up, focusing on the roots. Use the round brush to lift your hair at the roots, creating volume and bounce. </p><h3>Step 4: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a teasing comb to backcomb your hair at the crown. This will help to add some extra volume and texture to your locks. Be gentle when teasing your hair, and avoid pulling too hard.</p><h3>Step 5: Add Hairspray</h3><p>Finish off your fluffy hairstyle by adding some hairspray. This will help to hold your locks in place and prevent them from falling flat. Hold the hairspray about 10 inches away from your hair and spray lightly. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make a fluffy hairstyle:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.
