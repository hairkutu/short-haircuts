You can also maintain your fade at home by using clippers to trim the sides and back as needed. Make sure to use a high-quality pair of clippers and follow the same guard length your barber used for the initial cut.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How long does a fade last?</h3><p>A fade typically lasts 2-3 weeks before it starts to grow out and lose its shape.
