You can use clippers or scissors to trim the hair on the sides and back of your head. If you're using clippers, start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard until you reach your desired length.

Use a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type. Be sure to rinse thoroughly to remove any product buildup or dirt.</p><h3>Step 3: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is clean and dry, it's time to style your undercut.
