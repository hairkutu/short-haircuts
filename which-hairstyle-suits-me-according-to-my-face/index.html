The best hairstyles for round faces are those that add height to the crown and length to the face. Long layers, side-swept bangs, and asymmetrical cuts are great options for round faces. Avoid blunt cuts and chin-length bobs as they can make your face appear shorter and wider.</p><h3>How to:</h3><p>Ask your hairstylist to cut your hair in long layers that fall below your shoulders. Part your hair on the side and add side-swept bangs that graze your eyebrows. To add more height to the crown, tease your hair at the roots and spray with hairspray. Voila!

Long waves, sleek bobs, and pixie cuts are some great options for oval faces.</p><h3>How to:</h3><p>If you have long hair, add some soft waves and part your hair in the middle.

Just make sure that the fringe is not too heavy and blends well with the rest of your hair.</p><h2 id="square">Square Face</h2><p>If you have a square face shape, you want to soften the angles and add some curves. The best hairstyles for square faces are those that soften the jawline and add volume to the crown. Soft layers, side-swept bangs, and long waves are great options for square faces.
