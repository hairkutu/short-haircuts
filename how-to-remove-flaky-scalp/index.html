Therefore, it’s important to take steps to remove flakes and prevent them from coming back. The good news is that there are many effective remedies for flaky scalp, ranging from natural treatments to medicated shampoos.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Remove Flaky Scalp</h2><p>Here are some of the most effective ways to get rid of flaky scalp:</p><h3>1. Use a Medicated Shampoo</h3><p>One of the easiest and most effective ways to remove flaky scalp is to use a medicated shampoo. Look for shampoos that contain ingredients like salicylic acid, coal tar, or ketoconazole, which can help kill the yeast that causes dandruff.

You can also add a few drops of tea tree oil to your regular shampoo for added benefits.</p><h3>3. Try Apple Cider Vinegar</h3><p>Apple cider vinegar is another natural remedy that can help remove flaky scalp. Mix equal parts of apple cider vinegar and water, and apply the mixture to your scalp.
