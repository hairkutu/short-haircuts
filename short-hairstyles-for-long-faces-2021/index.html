Fear not! There are plenty of short hairstyles that can flatter long faces in 2021. In this article, we’ll go over some popular short hairstyles for long faces and provide tips on how to maintain them.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A long face is characterized by a high forehead, narrow cheeks, and a pointy chin. The goal of a short hairstyle for a long face is to add width to the face and balance out the proportions. Some popular short hairstyles for long faces include:</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a classic short hairstyle that works well for long faces. The short layers add volume to the top of the head, making the face appear wider. This hairstyle is low maintenance and perfect for those who don’t want to spend a lot of time styling their hair.</p><h3>Bob Cut</h3><p>The bob cut is another popular short hairstyle for long faces. A chin-length bob with layers can add volume to the sides of the face, creating the illusion of width. This hairstyle can be styled straight or with loose waves for a more textured look.</p><h3>Layered Cut</h3><p>A layered cut with side-swept bangs can also flatter a long face. The layers add volume to the sides of the face, while the bangs help to shorten the forehead. This hairstyle works well with straight or wavy hair.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you’re thinking about getting a short hairstyle for your long face, here are some things to keep in mind:</p><h3>Consult with a Hairstylist</h3><p>Before making any drastic changes to your hair, it’s important to consult with a hairstylist. They can recommend a hairstyle that will flatter your face shape and work with your hair texture.</p><h3>Consider Your Hair Texture</h3><p>The texture of your hair can also play a role in determining which short hairstyle will work best for you. If you have fine hair, a pixie cut with layers can add volume and texture. If you have thick hair, a bob cut with layers can help to thin out the hair and make it more manageable.</p><h3>Choose a Style That Fits Your Lifestyle</h3><p>When choosing a short hairstyle, it’s important to consider your lifestyle. If you’re always on the go and don’t have a lot of time to style your hair, a low-maintenance pixie cut may be the best option. If you have more time to devote to styling your hair, a layered cut with loose waves may work better.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some general steps for maintaining a short hairstyle:</p><h3>Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are designed for your hair type. Be sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid product buildup.</p><h3>Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a blow dryer to dry your hair, using a round brush to add volume and texture. If you have curly hair, you can use a diffuser attachment to enhance your natural curls.</p><h3>Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, you can style it using a styling product, such as wax or pomade. Use your fingers to work the product through your hair, creating the desired look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for maintaining a short hairstyle:</p><h3>Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Short hairstyles require frequent trims to maintain their shape. Be sure to visit your hairstylist every 4-6 weeks to keep your hair looking its best.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair from heat damage by using heat protectant products before styling with hot tools. You can also protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protection spray.</p><h3>Experiment with Different Styles</h3><p>Don’t be afraid to experiment with different styles and products to find the look that works best for you. You can try adding highlights or lowlights to add dimension to your hair or try a new styling product to achieve a different texture.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Will cutting my hair short make my face look longer?</h3><p>A: Not necessarily. Short hairstyles can actually help to balance out the proportions of a long face by adding width to the sides of the face.</p><h3>Q: Can I still style my short hair if I have a long face?</h3><p>A: Yes! There are plenty of short hairstyles that can be styled in different ways to create a unique look. You can add loose waves or curls to a bob cut or use a styling product to create a textured look with a pixie cut.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Maintaining healthy hair is important, regardless of the length or style. Here are some tips for keeping your hair healthy:</p><h3>Use the Right Products</h3><p>Use products that are designed for your hair type, whether it’s dry, oily, or color-treated. Be sure to read the labels and avoid products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair from Damage</h3><p>Avoid heat styling your hair too often, as this can damage the hair and cause split ends. You can also protect your hair from damage by wearing a hat or using a UV protection spray when spending time outdoors.</p><h3>Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth. Be sure to include foods that are high in protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, eggs, and leafy greens.</p><p>In conclusion, there are plenty of short hairstyles for long faces in 2021 that can flatter your features and give you a fresh new look. Consult with a hairstylist, choose a style that works with your hair texture and lifestyle, and don’t be afraid to experiment with different looks. With proper care and maintenance, your short hairstyle can look great all year round.</p></article>
