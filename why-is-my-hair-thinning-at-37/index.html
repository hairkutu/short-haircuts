Here are some tips:</p><h3>Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals can help keep your hair healthy. Make sure you're getting enough protein, iron, and vitamin D.</p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Excessive heat styling can damage your hair and cause it to become brittle and break. If you must use heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray.</p><h3>Reduce Stress</h3><p>Stress can cause hair thinning. Try to reduce your stress levels by practicing relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation.</p><h3>Use Gentle Hair Products</h3><p>Harsh chemicals in hair products can damage your hair and cause it to become thin.

Here's what you can do:</p><h3>Visit a Dermatologist</h3><p>A dermatologist can help determine the cause of your hair thinning and recommend treatment options.

Use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Tight hairstyles like braids and ponytails can pull on your hair and cause it to become thin. Opt for looser hairstyles instead.</p><h3>Get Enough Sleep</h3><p>Getting enough sleep is important for overall health and can help prevent hair thinning. Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Is hair thinning normal at age 37?</h3><p>Yes, hair thinning is normal at age 37.
