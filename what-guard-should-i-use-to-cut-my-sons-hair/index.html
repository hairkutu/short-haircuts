A guard is a small attachment that clips onto the blade of your clippers. It determines the length of the hair that is cut. Guards come in different sizes, ranging from 0.5mm to 25mm. The smaller the number, the closer the cut.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Choose the Right Guard</h3><p>Choosing the right guard can be overwhelming, especially if you're new to cutting hair. Here are some things to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Hair Type:</strong> The type of hair your son has will play a role in what guard to use. If he has thick, coarse hair, you may need a larger guard. If he has thin hair, you may need a smaller guard.</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> Think about how long you want your son's hair to be. If you want a shorter cut, you'll need a smaller guard. If you want a longer cut, you'll need a larger guard.</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> Consider the hairstyle you want to achieve. Different styles require different guards. For example, a crew cut requires a shorter guard, while a buzz cut requires an even shorter guard.</li></ul><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Your Son's Hair</h3><p>Now that you know what guard to use, let's talk about how to cut your son's hair.
