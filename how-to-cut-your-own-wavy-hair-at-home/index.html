This will create a guide for your cut.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Using your scissors, cut the hair below your fingers in a straight line. Don't worry about it being perfect, as we'll be adding layers in the next steps.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Repeat steps 3-5 on the other side of your head.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Take a small section of hair from one side of your head, close to your face.
