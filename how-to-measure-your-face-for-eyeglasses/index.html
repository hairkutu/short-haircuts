There are six basic face shapes: round, oval, square, heart, diamond, and triangle. To find your face shape, stand in front of a mirror and pull your hair back. Use a washable marker or lipstick to outline the shape of your face on the mirror. Compare your outline to the six basic face shapes and determine which one is closest to your own.</p><p>Once you've determined your face shape, you can use it to guide your eyeglass frame selection. Different frame shapes and styles flatter different face shapes, so it's important to choose a frame that complements your face shape.</p><h2 id="measuring-pd">Measuring Your Pupillary Distance</h2><p>Your pupillary distance (PD) is the distance between the centers of your pupils. This measurement is important because it determines where the optical center of your lenses should be placed for optimal vision. You can have your PD measured by an optometrist or you can measure it yourself at home.</p><p>To measure your PD at home, you'll need a ruler and a friend to help you. Stand facing your friend with your eyes level and your face straight ahead. Have your friend place the ruler against your brow, with the zero mark at the center of your left pupil. Ask your friend to measure the distance between the centers of your pupils in millimeters. Repeat the measurement a few times to ensure accuracy.</p><h2 id="measuring-face-width">Measuring Your Face Width</h2><p>Measuring your face width is important because it helps you determine the appropriate frame size for your face. To measure your face width, use a ruler to measure the distance between your temples. Start at the top of your left temple and measure to the top of your right temple. Record the measurement in millimeters.</p><h2 id="measuring-temple-length">Measuring Your Temple Length</h2><p>Your temple length is the distance from the hinge of your glasses to the earpiece.
