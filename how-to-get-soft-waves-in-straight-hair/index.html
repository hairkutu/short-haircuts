Here are the steps:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture. Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly to avoid any residue.</p><h3>2. Apply a Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before using any heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant to prevent damage to your hair. Use a light spray or cream, and distribute it evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>3. Use a Curling Iron</h3><p>Take small sections of your hair and wrap them around a curling iron. Hold the iron in place for a few seconds, then release the hair. Make sure to curl away from your face to create a natural-looking wave. Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled.</p><h3>4. Finger-Comb Your Hair</h3><p>After curling your hair, use your fingers to gently comb through the curls. This will create soft waves instead of tight curls. Don't worry if your hair looks a little messy at first - that's the look you're going for!</p><h3>5. Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>To keep your soft waves in place, finish with a light mist of hairspray. Hold the can about 12 inches away from your hair and spray evenly.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to help you get soft waves in straight hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start with clean hair.
