If you have curly hair, look for a shampoo and conditioner that defines curls and reduces frizz.</li><li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Avoid shampoos and conditioners that contain harsh chemicals such as sulfates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances. Instead, look for natural ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, and coconut oil that nourish and hydrate the hair.</li><li><strong>Scalp condition:</strong> If you have a dry or sensitive scalp, look for a shampoo and conditioner that soothes and moisturizes the scalp. If you have dandruff, look for a shampoo that contains salicylic acid or tea tree oil that helps control flaking.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> There are shampoos and conditioners available at different price points.
