The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and it's free to download.</p><h3>Step 2: Take a Photo</h3><p>Once you've downloaded the app, open it and take a photo of yourself. Make sure the lighting is good, and your face is fully visible in the photo.</p><h3>Step 3: Analyze Your Face Shape</h3><p>After you've taken a photo, the app will analyze your features and determine your face shape. The app will provide you with a visual representation of your face shape and a description of the characteristics of your face shape.</p><h3>Step 4: Get Recommendations</h3><p>Once your face shape is determined, the app will provide you with recommendations for hairstyles, makeup, and glasses that will complement your features.

The app uses facial recognition technology to analyze your features and determine your face shape.</p><h3>Is the app free?</h3><p>Yes, the "What's Your Face Shape" app is free to download and use.</p><h3>Is the app accurate?</h3><p>The app uses advanced facial recognition technology to analyze your features and determine your face shape.

Soft, layered cuts and side-swept bangs are great options.</p><h3>Heart Face Shape</h3><p>For a heart face shape, it's best to choose hairstyles that add volume to the bottom of your face. Long layers and side-swept bangs are great options.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, it's best to choose hairstyles that add width to your forehead and chin. Side-swept bangs and chin-length bobs are great options.</p><p>Now that you know everything about the "What's Your Face Shape" app, it's time to download it and find out your face shape.
