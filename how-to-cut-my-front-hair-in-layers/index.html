Use a pair of scissors to cut the hair at an angle, starting from the bottom and working your way up. This will create a gradual, layered effect.</p><p>Continue cutting small sections of hair, working your way from one side of your head to the other. Be sure to keep your fingers parallel to the angle of your cut, so that your layers are even.</p><h3>Step 4: Check Your Progress</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting, release the back section of your hair and check your progress in the mirror.
