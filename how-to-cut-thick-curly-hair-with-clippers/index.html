Do you have thick curly hair that can be difficult to manage? Cutting your own hair with clippers may seem intimidating, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be done successfully. In this guide, weâll walk you through how to cut thick curly hair with clippers in a relaxed and easy-to-understand language.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Cut Thick Curly Hair with Clippers</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Thick Curly Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Thick Curly Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Thick Curly Hair with Clippers</h2><p>Cutting thick curly hair with clippers requires a different approach than cutting straight or thin hair. Clippers are designed to cut hair evenly and quickly, making them a great tool for people with thick hair. However, itâs important to use the right clipper guard and technique to avoid cutting too much hair or creating an uneven look.</p><h3>What Youâll Need</h3><p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools:</p><ul><li>Clippers with adjustable guards</li><li>Comb</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Hair clips</li><li>Mirror</li><li>Towel or cape</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Follow these steps to cut your thick curly hair with clippers:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner, and then towel-dry or blow-dry it until itâs completely dry. Make sure there are no tangles or knots in your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using the comb, divide your hair into four sections: two on top of your head and two on the sides. Use hair clips to secure each section in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose Your Clipper Guard</h3><p>Select the clipper guard based on how much hair you want to cut. For thick curly hair, itâs best to start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard if needed.</p><h3>Step 4: Begin Cutting</h3><p>Starting with the longest guard, begin cutting the hair on the sides of your head first. Use the clippers to cut from the bottom of your hairline and work your way up to the top. Use a comb to lift the hair and ensure youâre cutting evenly.</p><p>Repeat this process on the other side, and then move to the top of your head. Use the same guard and technique to cut your hair on top, making sure to cut in the direction of your hair growth.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend and Fade</h3><p>Once youâve cut your hair with the longest guard, switch to a shorter guard and blend the hair at the sides and back of your head. Use a scissors to trim any long or uneven hairs, and then fade the hair from the sides to the top.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for Any Uneven Spots</h3><p>Use a mirror to check for any uneven spots or areas that need more trimming. Make sure to trim any hair thatâs sticking out or not blending well with the rest of your hair.</p><h3>Step 7: Clean Up</h3><p>Once youâre finished cutting your hair, use a towel or cape to brush off any loose hair. Clean your clippers and scissors, and put away your tools.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Thick Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you cut your thick curly hair with clippers:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard if needed</li><li>Cut your hair when itâs dry, as wet hair can be difficult to cut evenly</li><li>Use a comb to lift the hair and ensure youâre cutting evenly</li><li>Trim any long or uneven hairs with scissors</li><li>Fade the hair from the sides to the top for a more natural look</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I cut my hair with clippers without a guard?</h3><p>No, itâs not recommended to cut your hair with clippers without a guard as this can result in uneven cutting and damage to your hair.</p><h3>How often should I cut my thick curly hair?</h3><p>Itâs recommended to cut your hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain its shape and prevent split ends.</p><h3>Can I cut my hair with clippers if itâs wet?</h3><p>No, itâs best to cut your hair when itâs dry as wet hair can be difficult to cut evenly.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Thick Curly Hair</h2><p>To keep your thick curly hair looking its best, follow these hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when itâs dry, as this can cause frizz and breakage</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when itâs wet</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as this can damage your hair</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to define your curls and reduce frizz</li></ul><p>With these tips and techniques, cutting your own thick curly hair with clippers can be done successfully.
