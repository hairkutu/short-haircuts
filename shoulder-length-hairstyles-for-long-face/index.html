Look no further than shoulder length hairstyles! Not only do they frame your face beautifully, but they also give you plenty of styling options. In this article, we’ll provide you with a comprehensive guide on shoulder length hairstyles for long face, including how to choose the right style, step-by-step instructions, tips, FAQ, and hair care.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A long face is characterized by a high forehead, long and narrow shape, and pointed chin. The key to choosing the right hairstyle for a long face is to find one that adds width and volume to the sides of your face, creating a balanced look. Shoulder length hairstyles are perfect for this as they create an illusion of width and add fullness to the face.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Style</h2><p>When selecting a shoulder length hairstyle for a long face, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Layers:</strong> Layers help to add volume and texture to the hair, creating a more balanced look. Opt for long layers around the face that add width and fullness.</li><li><strong>Side-swept bangs:</strong> Side-swept bangs can help to shorten the face and add width. Avoid blunt bangs as they can elongate the face even more.</li><li><strong>Curls:</strong> Soft curls or waves can add width and volume to the sides of the face, making it appear more balanced. Avoid tight curls that can create a triangle shape on a long face.</li><li><strong>Straight hair:</strong> Straight hair can work well for a long face, but avoid having it fall flat against the face. Instead, add layers or waves to create volume and width.</li></ul><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some step-by-step instructions on how to achieve some popular shoulder length hairstyles for long face:</p><h3>Messy Lob</h3><ol><li>Start by washing and conditioning your hair.</li><li>Towel-dry your hair and apply a volumizing mousse.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair using a round brush, focusing on the roots to create volume.</li><li>Use a flat iron to create loose waves in random sections of your hair.</li><li>Apply a texturizing spray and use your fingers to loosen up the waves and create a messy look.</li></ol><h3>Straight and Layered</h3><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair.</li><li>Apply a heat protectant spray and blow-dry your hair using a round brush.</li><li>Use a flat iron to straighten your hair.</li><li>Create long layers around the face using hair cutting scissors.</li><li>Apply a frizz control serum and hairspray to hold the style in place.</li></ol><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when styling your shoulder length hair:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair to avoid breakage.</li><li>Apply a heat protectant spray before using any hot styling tools.</li><li>Use a volumizing mousse or texturizing spray to add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li>Invest in a good quality hair straightener or curling iron to avoid damaging your hair.</li><li>Visit a professional hair stylist regularly for trims and to maintain the health of your hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about shoulder length hairstyles for long face:</p><strong>Q: Is shoulder length hair suitable for all face shapes?</strong><br/> A: Shoulder length hair can work for most face shapes, but it’s important to choose the right style that flatters your face. For long faces, shoulder length hair can help to add width and balance. <strong>Q: How often should I trim my shoulder length hair?</strong><br/> A: It’s recommended to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain the health of your hair and prevent split ends. <strong>Q: Can I still wear my hair up with shoulder length hair?</strong><br/> A: Yes, shoulder length hair can be styled in a variety of updos and half updos. Try a messy bun or a braided crown for a cute and chic look. <h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Maintaining healthy hair is essential for achieving the perfect shoulder length hairstyle. Here are some hair care tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days to prevent over-drying.</li><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to prevent damage and breakage.</li><li>Avoid using hot styling tools every day and use a heat protectant spray when necessary.</li><li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet to promote hair growth and health.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you’re ready to rock any shoulder length hairstyle that flatters your long face. Experiment with different styles and have fun with your hair!</p></article>
