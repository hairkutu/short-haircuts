With the right tools and technique, you can achieve a professional-looking haircut without leaving your home. In this guide, we'll show you how to cut men's hair with clippers in 2020.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Before we get started, make sure you have the right tools for the job. You'll need a set of clippers with different guard sizes, a comb, a pair of scissors, and a mirror. It's also a good idea to have a towel or cape to protect clothing from stray hairs.</p><p>Once you have your tools ready, follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying the hair. This will make it easier to work with and ensure a clean cut. Use a towel to dry hair completely.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Guard Size</h3><p>Attach the appropriate guard size to your clippers. The guard size will determine how short the hair will be cut. Start with the longest guard size and work your way down if you want a shorter cut.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Starting at the nape of the neck, use the clippers to cut the hair in an upward motion. Move the clippers from the bottom of the hairline to the top. Use the comb to guide the hair into the clippers.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Sides</h3><p>Once you've cut the back of the head, move to the sides. Use the same technique, but start at the bottom and work your way up. Use a slightly shorter guard size to blend the sides into the back.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3><p>Use scissors to cut the hair on top of the head. Start at the front and work your way to the back. Use the comb to lift the hair and cut it to the desired length.</p><h3>Step 6: Trim the Edges</h3><p>Use clippers to trim the edges of the hairline around the ears and neck. Use a shorter guard size to create a clean line.</p><h3>Step 7: Check for Evenness</h3><p>Use a mirror to check for evenness. Look for any spots that need to be touched up or trimmed.</p><h3>Step 8: Clean Up</h3><p>Once you're satisfied with the haircut, use a brush or towel to remove any stray hairs. Remove the guard from the clippers and clean them with a brush.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down for a shorter cut.</li><li>Use a comb to guide the hair into the clippers for a more even cut.</li><li>Use scissors to cut the hair on top of the head to avoid cutting too much off at once.</li><li>Check for evenness by using a mirror.</li><li>Practice makes perfect!</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting men's hair with clippers:</p><h3>Can I cut my own hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair with clippers. Just make sure you have the right tools and follow the steps carefully.</p><h3>What if I make a mistake?</h3><p>If you make a mistake, it's okay. Hair grows back! You can always go to a professional to fix any mistakes or uneven spots.</p><h3>How often should I cut my hair?</h3><p>This depends on your hair type and desired length. Generally, it's recommended to get a haircut every 4-6 weeks.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to take care of it. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo.</li><li>Use conditioner to keep hair soft and manageable.</li><li>Avoid using excessive heat on your hair, such as blow dryers or straighteners.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protectant spray.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote hair growth and health.</li></ul><p>With these tips and techniques, you'll be able to cut men's hair with clippers like a pro. Whether you're cutting your own hair or someone else's, you can achieve a stylish and professional-looking haircut from the comfort of your own home. </p></article>
