The Crush Fashion</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>In order to achieve a desired look for your long curly hair, sometimes it’s necessary to use thinning shears. Thinning shears are a type of scissors that have teeth on one blade and a smooth edge on the other. They are designed to cut hair without removing too much of its volume. In this article, we will explain how to use thinning shears on long curly hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thinning shears are used to reduce the volume of hair without changing the length. They are ideal for thinning out thick hair, reducing bulk, and creating texture. They can be used on both wet and dry hair. When using thinning shears, it’s important to remember that you should only cut a small amount of hair at a time to avoid over-thinning.</p><h2>How to Use Thinning Shears on Long Curly Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>The first step in using thinning shears on long curly hair is to wash and dry your hair. Use a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for curly hair to help maintain its natural texture. Once you’ve washed your hair, gently towel dry it and let it air dry until it’s around 80% dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, section your hair into manageable sections using clips. Start by parting your hair down the middle and then divide each side into two or three sections, depending on how thick your hair is. This will make it easier to work with and help you achieve a more even look.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Thinning Out Your Hair</h3><p>Now it’s time to start thinning out your hair. Begin by taking a small section of hair and holding it between your fingers. Use the thinning shears to cut into the hair, starting about an inch away from the scalp. Make sure to only cut a small amount of hair at a time to avoid over-thinning. Repeat this process throughout your hair, working section by section.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Layers</h3><p>Once you’ve thinned out your hair, it’s important to blend the layers to create a natural look. To do this, take a pair of regular scissors and cut into the ends of your hair at an angle. This will create a more natural transition between the layers and help to reduce any harsh lines.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Only use thinning shears on the ends of your hair to avoid a choppy look</li><li>Use a comb to help guide your thinning shears and ensure an even cut</li><li>Start with a small amount of hair and work your way up to avoid over-thinning</li><li>Take breaks if you need to and don’t rush the process</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can thinning shears be used on all types of hair?</h3><p>Thinning shears can be used on all types of hair, but they are especially effective on thick hair. If you have fine hair, it’s important to be careful when using thinning shears as they can cause your hair to look too thin.</p><h3>How often should I use thinning shears on my hair?</h3><p>It depends on how quickly your hair grows and how much volume you want to maintain. If you want to keep your hair looking full, you may only need to use thinning shears every few months. If you want to reduce the volume of your hair, you may need to use them more frequently.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After using thinning shears on your long curly hair, it’s important to take care of it properly. Use a leave-in conditioner to help hydrate your hair and maintain its natural texture. Avoid using heat tools as much as possible and try to air dry your hair whenever you can. Regular trims can also help to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>Using thinning shears on long curly hair can be a great way to achieve the look you want without losing too much volume. By following these steps, you can use thinning shears safely and effectively on your hair.</p></article>
