The answer is yes! You can absolutely cut your hair short, regardless of your face shape. However, there are certain styles that can flatter your features and complement your face shape.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face is characterized by soft, circular features. Your cheekbones and jawline are typically similar in width, and your forehead may be slightly wider than your chin.

Ask your stylist for layers that start at your cheekbones and angle downward.</p><h3>3. Avoid Blunt Cuts</h3><p>A blunt cut can make your face look even rounder. Instead, opt for a cut with layers and texture.</p><h3>4. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can help break up the circular shape of your face and draw attention to your eyes.
