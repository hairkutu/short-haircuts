If you want a messy, textured look, use your fingers to tousle your hair. If you want a sleek, polished look, use a comb to create a part and smooth your hair down. 5. Use a blow dryer to set the style. Use a low heat setting and a diffuser attachment to dry your hair without causing damage. Use your fingers to shape your hair as you dry it. 6.
