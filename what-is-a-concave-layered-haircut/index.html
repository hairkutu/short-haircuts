The layers can be subtle or more pronounced, depending on your preference, and the style can be customized to suit your face shape and personal style.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you're interested in trying out a concave layered haircut, the first step is to book an appointment with a professional stylist. They will be able to assess your hair type and face shape, and recommend the best technique and length for your hair.
