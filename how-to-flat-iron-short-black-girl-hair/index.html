You'll need a flat iron with adjustable temperature settings, a heat protectant spray, a comb or brush, and a hair tie or clips to section off your hair.</p><p>Here are the steps to flat iron short black girl hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair hydrated and healthy. Rinse thoroughly and gently towel dry your hair, being careful not to rub too hard.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant Spray</h3><p>Before using any heat styling tools, it's important to protect your hair from damage. Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair, focusing on the ends where the hair is most fragile. Comb through your hair to distribute the product evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using a comb or brush, section your hair into small sections. Use a hair tie or clips to keep each section separate.</p><h3>Step 4: Adjust Your Flat Iron Temperature</h3><p>Adjust your flat iron temperature based on your hair type and texture. For fine or damaged hair, use a lower temperature setting. For thicker or coarser hair, use a higher temperature setting.</p><h3>Step 5: Start Flat Ironing</h3><p>Starting with one section of hair, clamp the flat iron as close to the root as possible. Slowly glide the flat iron down the length of your hair, being careful not to stop or pause in one spot for too long. Repeat this process with each section of hair, working your way around your head.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with a Serum or Oil</h3><p>Once you've flat ironed all of your hair, finish with a serum or oil to add shine and smoothness. Apply a small amount to your palms and run your hands over your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to flat ironing short black girl hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start with clean, freshly washed hair.
