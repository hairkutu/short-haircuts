Curly hair is more prone to dryness and frizz, so it requires extra moisture and hydration. Here are some tips on how to maintain curly hair girl:</p><h3>1.

Use a deep conditioner once a week to keep your curls soft and healthy.</p><h3>3. Don't brush your hair when it's dry</h3><p>Curly hair can be easily damaged and tangled when brushed dry. Detangle your hair with your fingers or a wide-tooth comb when it's wet and coated with conditioner.</p><h3>4. Use a diffuser</h3><p>A diffuser can help to dry curly hair without causing frizz. Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to gently dry your curls.</p><h3>5. Sleep on a satin pillowcase</h3><p>Satin pillowcases reduce friction and prevent tangles and breakage.
