The amount of yarn needed depends on the length and thickness of your hair, as well as the desired length and thickness of the braids. Generally, you will need around 3-4 skeins of yarn for a full head of medium-sized braids.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>To determine how much yarn you will need for your yarn braids, you will need to take a few measurements.
