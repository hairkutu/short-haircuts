If you have fine hair, you'll want to use products that add texture and volume. If you have thick hair, you may need to thin it out a bit to make the updo more manageable. Once you've got your hair prepped and ready to go, it's time to start styling!</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h3><p>Before you start styling, make sure you have all the tools you need. You'll need a comb, hair ties, bobby pins, and any other accessories you want to use. It's also a good idea to have some hairspray on hand to keep your updo in place.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose Your Updo</h3><p>There are endless options when it comes to medium length hair updos, so it's important to choose one that works for you. Some popular choices include braids, buns, and twists. We'll cover each of these in more detail below.</p><h3>Step 3: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start styling, you'll want to prep your hair. This can vary depending on your hair type, but generally, you'll want to start with clean, dry hair. If you have fine hair, you may want to add some texture with a sea salt spray or texturizing powder. If you have thick hair, you may need to blow dry and straighten it to make it more manageable.</p><h2 id="braids">Braids</h2><p>Braids are a great option for medium length hair updos. They're easy to do and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Here's how to create a simple braided updo:</p><h3>Step 1: Part Your Hair</h3><p>Start by parting your hair down the middle. Then, take a small section of hair from the front on one side and braid it all the way down. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Step 2: Pull the Braids Back</h3><p>Take the two braids and pull them back, securing them with a hair tie. Make sure they're positioned where you want your updo to sit.</p><h3>Step 3: Create the Updo</h3><p>Take the loose ends of the braids and twist them together, creating a bun at the back of your head. Secure with bobby pins and hairspray to keep it in place.</p><h2 id="buns">Buns</h2><p>Buns are another popular choice for medium length hair updos.

Make sure it's positioned where you want your updo to sit.</p><h3>Step 2: Create the Bun</h3><p>Take the ponytail and twist it around itself, creating a bun. Secure with bobby pins and hairspray to keep it in place.</p><h2 id="twists">Twists</h2><p>Twists are a great way to add some texture and dimension to your medium length hair updo.
