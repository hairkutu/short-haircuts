Undercutting involves shaving the hair underneath the top layer, creating a hidden layer that can be revealed with different styling techniques. This edgy look has become increasingly popular in recent years, but is it right for you? In this post, we'll go over everything you need to know about undercutting your long hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>An undercut involves shaving the hair underneath the top layer, creating a hidden layer that can be revealed with different styling techniques.
