During pregnancy, the body experiences hormonal changes that can boost hair growth. As a result, many women enjoy thicker and fuller hair during pregnancy. However, after giving birth, the hormones return to their normal levels, causing the hair to fall out. Here are some ways to stop hair fall after pregnancy:</p><h3>1. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy and balanced diet can provide your body with the necessary nutrients for healthy hair growth.

Practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, to reduce stress.</p><h3>3.

Avoid tight hairstyles and opt for loose hairstyles that don't pull on the hair.</p><h3>4.
