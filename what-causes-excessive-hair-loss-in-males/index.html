It is also known as androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness. If your father or grandfather experienced hair loss, then there is a high chance that you will also experience hair loss.</p><p>Male-pattern baldness is caused by a combination of genes and male sex hormones called androgens. Androgens play a crucial role in regulating hair growth. However, in some men, the hair follicles are sensitive to androgens, which causes them to shrink and stop producing hair.</p><h2 id="hormonalchanges">Hormonal Changes</h2><p>Hormonal changes can also cause excessive hair loss in males. Hormonal changes can be caused by several factors, such as age, puberty, and thyroid problems.</p><p>During puberty, the body undergoes several hormonal changes, which can cause hair loss. The same goes for aging. As men age, their bodies produce less testosterone, which can cause hair loss.</p><p>Thyroid problems can also cause hair loss. The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism. However, if the gland produces too much or too little hormone, it can cause hair loss.</p><h2 id="stress">Stress</h2><p>Stress is another factor that can cause excessive hair loss in males. When you are stressed, your body produces a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol can interfere with the hair growth cycle and cause hair loss.</p><p>Stress can also cause a condition called telogen effluvium. Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss that occurs when the hair follicles enter the resting phase prematurely. This condition can be caused by stress, illness, or surgery.</p><h2 id="poorhaircare">Poor Hair Care</h2><p>Poor hair care can also cause hair loss in males. If you use harsh chemicals on your hair, such as hair dyes or relaxers, it can cause damage to your hair follicles and lead to hair loss.</p><p>Using hot tools on your hair, such as flat irons or blow dryers, can also cause hair damage and lead to hair loss. It is essential to take good care of your hair and avoid harsh chemicals and hot tools.</p><h2 id="medications">Medications</h2><p>Some medications can cause hair loss in males. Medications that are used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, and heart problems can cause hair loss. If you are experiencing hair loss and are taking medication, it is essential to talk to your doctor.</p><h2 id="diseases">Diseases</h2><p>Some diseases can cause hair loss in males. Diseases such as lupus, alopecia areata, and fungal infections can cause hair loss. If you are experiencing hair loss, it is essential to talk to your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p><h2 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Is male-pattern baldness treatable?</h3><p>A: Male-pattern baldness is not curable, but it is treatable. There are several treatments available, such as hair transplant surgery, medication, and laser therapy.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause permanent hair loss?</h3><p>A: No, stress does not cause permanent hair loss.
