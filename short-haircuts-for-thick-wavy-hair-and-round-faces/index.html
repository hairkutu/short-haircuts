Do you often find it difficult to choose the right haircut that flatters your features? Look no further as we bring you a comprehensive guide to the best short haircuts for thick wavy hair and round faces in 2023. </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thick wavy hair can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. While it looks voluminous and adds texture to your look, it can be difficult to manage and style. And when you combine it with a round face, finding the right haircut becomes even more challenging. However, with the right guidance, you can rock a short haircut that accentuates your best features and makes you feel confident and beautiful.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Short Haircut?</h2><p>Before we dive into the best short haircuts for thick wavy hair and round faces, it's essential to understand some basic rules that can help you choose the right haircut for your face shape and hair type. </p><h3>Step 1: Identify Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step is to determine your face shape. Round faces have a circular shape, with the cheekbones being the widest part of the face. Measure your face from the widest point of your cheekbones and compare it to the width of your forehead and jawline. If they're almost equal, you have a round face shape. </p><h3>Step 2: Consider Your Hair Type</h3><p>The next step is to evaluate your hair type. Thick wavy hair has a lot of volume and texture, which can be challenging to manage with longer hair. A shorter haircut can help you tame your hair and bring out its natural texture. </p><h3>Step 3: Find Inspiration</h3><p>Once you've identified your face shape and hair type, it's time to look for inspiration. Browse through magazines, social media, or consult with your hairstylist to find short haircuts that suit your features and personality.</p><h2>Best Short Haircuts for Thick Wavy Hair and Round Faces</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right short haircut let's explore the best options for thick wavy hair and round faces. </p><h3>1. Pixie Cut</h3><p>Pixie cuts are a popular choice for women with round faces and thick hair. They're low-maintenance, versatile, and can be styled in many ways. A pixie cut with layers and texture can add dimension to your hair and make your face look slimmer. </p><h3>2. Bob Cut</h3><p>Bobs are another classic haircut that never goes out of style. They're perfect for women with round faces and thick hair as they add structure and shape to your hair. A chin-length bob with layers and side-swept bangs can balance out your face and accentuate your best features.</p><h3>3. Shag Cut</h3><p>A shag cut is a layered haircut that works well with thick wavy hair. It adds volume and texture to your hair and creates a messy, effortless look. A shag cut with longer layers and choppy ends can make your face look slimmer and elongate your neck.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Haircuts for Thick Wavy Hair and Round Faces</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the right short haircut, it's essential to maintain it to keep it looking fresh and stylish. Here are some tips for maintaining short haircuts for thick wavy hair and round faces:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body to your hair.</li><li>Avoid using heavy hair products that weigh down your hair.</li><li>Get regular trims every 6-8 weeks to keep your haircut in shape.</li><li>Invest in a good quality hairbrush to detangle your hair without causing breakage.</li><li>Experiment with different styling techniques like blow-drying, curling, or straightening to create different looks.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What short haircut is best for a round face?</h3><p>Pixie cuts, bobs, and shag cuts are some of the best short haircuts for round faces as they add structure and shape to your hair and make your face look slimmer.</p><h3>Can you have short hair with thick wavy hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can have short hair with thick wavy hair.
