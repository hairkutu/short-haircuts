However, for those with curly hair, styling bangs can be a challenge. Curly hair tends to be more voluminous and textured, so it's important to choose a bang style that complements your curls.</p><p>There are various types of bangs that suit curly hair, such as side-swept bangs, curtain bangs, and baby bangs. Side-swept bangs are the most popular style for curly hair since they blend in well with the curls and frame your face.
