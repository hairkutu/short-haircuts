Here are the basic steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You will need:</p><ul><li>Scissors (preferably hairdressing scissors)</li><li>Comb</li><li>Clippers (optional)</li><li>Mirror</li><li>Spray bottle</li><li>Hair ties or clips</li></ul><h3>2. Choose Your Hairstyle</h3><p>Decide on the hairstyle you want to achieve. Look up tutorials or pictures online to get inspiration and a clear idea of what you want to do.</p><h3>3. Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair and let it dry completely before you start cutting. Wet hair is harder to cut and style, and can result in uneven cuts.</p><h3>4. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use hair ties or clips to section your hair. Start with the bottom layer and work your way up. This will make it easier to cut your hair evenly.</p><h3>5. Cut Your Hair</h3><p>Start cutting your hair, following the style you have chosen. Use the comb to hold the hair in place and cut with the scissors. Use the clippers to trim the sides and back, if necessary. Take your time and make sure you are cutting evenly.</p><h3>6. Check Your Work</h3><p>Use the mirror to check your work. Make any necessary adjustments and touch-ups.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to self cut hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have all the necessary tools.

You can always cut more, but you can't put hair back once it's cut.</li><li>Use a spray bottle to dampen your hair if it's too dry or frizzy.</li><li>Don't be afraid to ask for help.
