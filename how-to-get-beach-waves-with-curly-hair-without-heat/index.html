Curly hair tends to be more fragile and prone to breakage, so it's essential to take extra care when styling it. Here are some tips to help you achieve those beautiful beach waves:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Start by using a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for curly hair. Look for products that contain natural ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe vera. These ingredients help to moisturize and define your curls, making them easier to style.</p><h3>2.

Make sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><h3>3. Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into two sections and braid each section tightly. Make sure to start the braid as close to your scalp as possible, and keep braiding until you reach the ends of your hair. Secure each braid with a hair tie or clip.</p><h3>4. Sleep on It</h3><p>Once your hair is braided, it's time to go to bed. Sleeping on your braids will help to set your beach waves naturally. In the morning, carefully undo the braids and use your fingers to gently separate the waves.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Now that you know the basics of how to get beach waves with curly hair without heat let's break it down step-by-step:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for curly hair.
