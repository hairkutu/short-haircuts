Make sure to roll your hair in the direction that you want your curls to go.</p><h3>Step 5: Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Once all of your hair is rolled, use a blow dryer to dry your hair completely. This will help to set the curls in place.</p><h3>Step 6: Remove the Perm Rods</h3><p>Once your hair is completely dry, carefully remove the perm rods. You should be left with tight, bouncy curls.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Hair</h3><p>You can leave your curls as they are, or you can style them further using a curling iron or styling wand.
