Here are the basic steps you'll need to follow:</p><h3>1. Gather your tools</h3><p>You'll need a good pair of hair cutting scissors, a comb, and hair clips to keep your hair in place.</p><h3>2. Start with dry hair</h3><p>It's best to cut your bangs when they are dry so you can see exactly how they will fall.</p><h3>3. Section your bangs</h3><p>Using your comb, section off your bangs from the rest of your hair. Decide how much you want to cut off, and clip the remaining hair out of the way.</p><h3>4. Cut your bangs</h3><p>Using your scissors, cut your bangs at an angle. Start at the center of your forehead and work your way outwards, cutting small sections at a time. Be careful not to cut too much at once.</p><h3>5. Check your work</h3><p>After each cut, let your bangs fall naturally and check the length. You can always cut more, but you can't put hair back once it's been cut!</p><h3>6. Blend your layers</h3><p>If you want to add more layers, repeat the process by sectioning off a small amount of hair and cutting at an angle. Make sure to blend the layers with your existing bangs so they look seamless.</p><h3>7. Style your bangs</h3><p>Once you're happy with your layers, style your bangs as desired. You can blow dry them straight or use a curling iron for a more textured look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed guide to layering your own bangs:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start with clean, dry hair.
