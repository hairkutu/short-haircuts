Use a mirror to get a good look at the back of your head and determine where you want to cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Wet Your Hair</h3><p>Spray your hair with water to make it easier to cut. If you have thicker hair, you may want to use a hair clip to section off your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Using your scissors, start cutting your hair. Work in small sections and make sure to cut straight across. If you want a layered look, hold the hair at an angle and snip into the ends.</p><h3>Step 4: Use Clippers (Optional)</h3><p>If you want a shorter, more uniform look, you can use clippers. Start with the longest guard and work your way down to the shortest.
