It may appear thicker because the hair has a blunt tip, but it's just an illusion.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I shave or wax my legs?</strong></p><p>A: That depends on personal preference. Some people shave or wax their legs daily, while others do it once every few weeks. It's essential to listen to your body and avoid over-shaving or waxing.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use hair growth products to speed up leg hair growth?</strong></p><p>A: There are several hair growth products available in the market, but their effectiveness varies from person to person.
