You can either wash your hair or wet it down in the shower or with a spray bottle. Once your hair is damp, you'll need to apply a styling product. A good option for creating waves is a sea salt spray. This type of product can help add texture and definition to your hair.</p><p>Next, you'll want to use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer. This attachment can help to distribute heat more evenly and prevent frizz. Start by scrunching your hair with your hands, then use the diffuser to dry your hair on low heat. As you dry, continue to scrunch your hair to encourage the wave pattern.</p><p>Once your hair is dry, you can use a curling iron or wand to further define your waves. However, you'll want to use a larger barrel size than you would for creating curls. A 1-1.5 inch barrel can help create loose, natural-looking waves.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3><p>Here's a breakdown of the steps to make curly hair wavy:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, damp hair.</li><li>Apply a sea salt spray or other styling product.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair on low heat, scrunching as you go.</li><li>Use a curling iron or wand with a larger barrel size to define your waves.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for Creating Wavy Hair</h3><p>Here are some additional tips to help you create wavy hair:</p><ul><li>Don't over-dry your hair with the diffuser.
