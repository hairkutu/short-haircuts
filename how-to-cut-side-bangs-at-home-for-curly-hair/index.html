Well, you don't have to anymore! With this step-by-step guide, you can easily cut your own side bangs at home for your curly hair. But before we begin, here are some things you'll need:</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>A comb</li><li>A mirror</li><li>A spray bottle filled with water</li></ul><h2>How to Cut Side Bangs at Home for Curly Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>The first step in cutting your side bangs is to wash and dry your hair. It's important to do this because you want your hair to be in its natural state when you cut it. Once your hair is dry, comb it out so it's tangle-free.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, you need to section your hair. Take the front section of your hair and separate it from the rest of your hair. Use a comb to part your hair in the middle, creating two even sections on either side of your face. Pull the sections forward and clip them to keep them out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Decide on the Length of Your Bangs</h3><p>Decide on the length of your bangs. It's important to note that when your hair is curly, it will look shorter than it actually is when it's straight. So, if you're unsure about the length, start with a longer length and gradually cut more if needed.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut Your Bangs</h3><p>Now it's time to cut your bangs. Start by taking a small section of hair from the front of your hairline. Hold the hair between your fingers and slide your fingers down to the length you want your bangs to be. Cut the hair at an angle, starting from the middle and moving outward. This will create a soft, blended look.</p><p>Repeat this process on the other side of your face, making sure to cut your hair at the same angle as the first side. Keep in mind that it's always better to cut less than to cut too much. You can always go back and trim more if needed.</p><h3>Step 5: Check Your Work</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your bangs, it's important to check your work. Take a few steps back from the mirror and look at your hair from different angles. Make sure your bangs are even and the length is what you want it to be.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Side Bangs at Home for Curly Hair</h2><ul><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid damaging your hair.</li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet. It will look shorter when it's dry and curly.</li><li>Start with a longer length and gradually cut more if needed.

It's better to take your time and get it right than rush and make a mistake.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Can I cut my own side bangs at home?</h3><p>Yes, you can! With the right tools and some patience, you can easily cut your own side bangs at home.</p><h3>What scissors should I use to cut my side bangs?</h3><p>Use sharp scissors to avoid damaging your hair.

Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your curls healthy and hydrated. You can also use a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to define your curls.
