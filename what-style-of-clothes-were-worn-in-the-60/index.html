The clothes worn during this time were colorful, experimental, and often incorporated elements of pop art and youth culture. In this article, we’ll explore the key styles and trends of the 60s, and how you can incorporate them into your wardrobe today.</p><h2>What Were the Key Styles of the 60s?</h2><h3>Mod Fashion</h3><p>Mod fashion was a key style of the 60s, and was characterized by bold colors, geometric patterns, and short hemlines. Mini skirts, shift dresses, and go-go boots were all popular mod fashion items, and were often worn with bold accessories such as statement jewelry and oversized sunglasses.</p><h3>Hippie Fashion</h3><p>Hippie fashion was another popular style of the 60s, and was defined by loose-fitting garments, natural fabrics, and bohemian prints. Fringed vests, bell-bottom jeans, and tie-dye shirts were all key hippie fashion items, and were often worn with sandals and floppy hats.</p><h3>Bouffant Hairstyles</h3><p>In addition to their clothes, women in the 60s were also known for their elaborate hairstyles. The bouffant was a popular style during this era, and involved teasing the hair at the crown of the head to create a voluminous, rounded shape. Other popular hairstyles included the beehive and the pixie cut.</p><h2>How to Incorporate 60s Style into Your Wardrobe Today</h2><p>If you want to incorporate 60s style into your wardrobe today, there are plenty of ways to do so. Here are a few tips:</p><h3>Go for Bold Colors and Prints</h3><p>One of the defining features of 60s fashion was its use of bold colors and prints. To incorporate this into your wardrobe today, look for pieces in bright, eye-catching hues, or with bold, graphic prints.</p><h3>Experiment with Hemlines</h3><p>The 60s were all about experimentation, and this extended to hemlines as well. To channel 60s style, try wearing a mini skirt or a shift dress with bare legs, or pair a maxi dress with platform sandals.</p><h3>Accessorize with Statement Pieces</h3><p>To complete your 60s-inspired look, don’t forget to add some bold accessories. Oversized sunglasses, chunky jewelry, and colorful scarves are all great options, and can help to add some fun and flair to your outfit.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What were popular fabrics in the 60s?</h3><p>Popular fabrics in the 60s included natural fibers such as cotton, wool, and silk, as well as synthetic materials such as polyester and nylon.</p><h3>What were popular shoe styles in the 60s?</h3><p>Popular shoe styles in the 60s included go-go boots, platform sandals, and Mary Janes.</p><h3>What were popular hairstyles in the 60s?</h3><p>Popular hairstyles in the 60s included the bouffant, the beehive, and the pixie cut.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for 60s-Inspired Hairstyles</h2><p>If you want to recreate a 60s-inspired hairstyle, here are a few tips:</p><h3>Invest in a Good Teasing Comb</h3><p>To create a bouffant or other teased hairstyle, you’ll need a good teasing comb. Look for one with long, fine teeth that can easily separate and lift your hair.</p><h3>Use Hairspray to Set Your Style</h3><p>Once you’ve teased your hair into the desired shape, use a strong-hold hairspray to set it in place. This will help your style to last all day.</p><h3>Don’t Overwash Your Hair</h3><p>Overwashing your hair can strip it of its natural oils, which can make it harder to style. Instead, try washing your hair every other day, and use dry shampoo to refresh it in between washes.</p><p>In conclusion, 60s fashion was all about experimentation, color, and fun. By incorporating some of these key styles and trends into your wardrobe and hairstyle today, you can channel the spirit of this iconic era and make it your own.</p></article>
