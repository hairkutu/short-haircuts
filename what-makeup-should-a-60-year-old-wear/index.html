As we age, our skin changes and we need to adjust our makeup to suit our changing needs. In this article, we will discuss what makeup a 60 year old should wear to look and feel their best. Read on to learn more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>As we age, our skin loses elasticity and becomes drier. This means that we need to use makeup products that are hydrating and nourishing. We also need to be mindful of fine lines and wrinkles and choose products that will not settle into them.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The first step in any makeup routine is to start with a clean and moisturized face. Use a gentle cleanser and a moisturizer that is suitable for mature skin. Once your skin is prepped, you can begin your makeup application.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>1. Start with a primer: A primer will help to smooth out any fine lines and wrinkles and create a smooth base for your makeup.</p><p>2. Apply foundation: Choose a foundation that is hydrating and has a dewy finish. Avoid matte foundations as they can make your skin look dull and dry.</p><p>3. Conceal: Use a concealer to cover any dark circles or blemishes. Be sure to choose a concealer that is hydrating and will not settle into fine lines.</p><p>4. Add some color: Use a cream blush to add a pop of color to your cheeks. Cream blushes are hydrating and will give you a natural, youthful glow.</p><p>5. Define your eyes: Use a neutral eyeshadow palette to define your eyes. Avoid using dark, heavy eye makeup as it can make your eyes look smaller.</p><p>6. Add some mascara: Use a lengthening mascara to give your lashes some volume and definition.</p><p>7. Finish with a lip color: Choose a hydrating lipstick or lip gloss to finish off your look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>1. Avoid using powder products as they can settle into fine lines and make your skin look dry.</p><p>2. Use a hydrating setting spray to set your makeup and give your skin a dewy finish.</p><p>3. Choose makeup colors that complement your skin tone and hair color.</p><p>4. Invest in high-quality makeup brushes to ensure a flawless application.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Q: Can I still wear bold lipstick colors?</p><p>A: Yes, you can still wear bold lipstick colors! Just be sure to choose a hydrating formula that will not dry out your lips.</p><p>Q: Do I need to use a different makeup routine for daytime and nighttime?</p><p>A: It is not necessary to use a different makeup routine for daytime and nighttime. You can simply adjust the intensity of your makeup to suit the occasion.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>As we age, our hair also changes. It becomes thinner, drier, and more prone to breakage. To keep your hair looking healthy and youthful, follow these tips:</p><p>1. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that is formulated for aging hair.</p><p>2. Avoid using hot styling tools such as straighteners and curling irons as they can damage your hair.</p><p>3. Use a hydrating hair mask once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><p>4. Consider getting a shorter haircut that is more flattering for mature women.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As a 60 year old woman, you can still look and feel your best with the right makeup and hair care routine. Remember to choose products that are hydrating and nourishing, and be mindful of fine lines and wrinkles. With these tips, you can embrace your age and feel confident and beautiful.</p></article>
