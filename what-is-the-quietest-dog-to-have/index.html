However, some breeds are generally known for their calm and quiet nature:</p><h3>1. Basenji</h3><p>The Basenji is a small African hunting dog that doesn't bark but makes a yodel-like sound. They are independent and reserved but affectionate with their owners. Basenjis are also clean and low-shedding, making them an ideal choice for people with allergies.</p><h3>2. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h3><p>This charming breed is a favorite among many due to their friendly and gentle nature. Cavaliers are not known for excessive barking and adapt well to apartment living. They enjoy human company and love to cuddle.</p><h3>3. Greyhound</h3><p>Despite their reputation as racing dogs, Greyhounds are laid-back and calm in the house. They are sensitive and affectionate with their families and don't require much exercise. Greyhounds also have short coats that are easy to maintain.</p><h3>4. Newfoundland</h3><p>Newfoundlands are massive dogs that are famous for their water rescue abilities. However, they are also known for their sweet and docile temperament. Newfs are quiet and don't bark much, but they do drool and shed a lot. They are best suited for people with large homes and yards.</p><h3>5. Scottish Deerhound</h3><p>The Scottish Deerhound is a tall and regal breed that is quiet and reserved. They are gentle and loyal with their families and get along with other pets.
