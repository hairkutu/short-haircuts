Numbing cream can be applied to the skin prior to treatment to minimize discomfort.</p><h3>Is microneedling safe?</h3><p>Microneedling is generally considered safe when performed by a professional or following proper at-home technique. However, there is a risk of infection if the needles are not properly sanitized or if the skin is not properly cared for after treatment.</p><h3>How often should I perform microneedling?</h3><p>For optimal results, it's recommended to perform microneedling every 4-6 weeks.
