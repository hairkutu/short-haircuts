The decade was known for its iconic fashion trends, including mod styles, psychedelic prints, and hippie fashion. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what type of clothes were worn in the 60's and how you can incorporate these styles into your own wardrobe today.</p><h2>What Was the Fashion Like in the 60's?</h2><p>The fashion in the 60's was influenced by the social and cultural changes of the time. The mod movement emerged in London, and its influence quickly spread throughout the world. Mod fashion was all about clean lines, bold patterns, and bright colors. This style was popularized by British bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, who often wore tailored suits and skinny ties on stage.</p><p>Psychedelic prints were also popular in the 60's, especially among the counterculture movement. These prints featured bold colors, swirling patterns, and trippy designs. Hippie fashion was all about embracing natural fabrics, loose-fitting clothing, and a casual, bohemian style. The hippie movement was a rejection of mainstream culture and focused on peace, love, and self-expression.</p><h2>How Can You Incorporate 60's Fashion into Your Wardrobe?</h2><p>If you're looking to add some 60's-inspired pieces to your wardrobe, there are several ways to do it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Go for Bold Patterns</h3><p>One of the defining features of 60's fashion was bold patterns. Look for pieces with psychedelic prints, geometric shapes, and bright colors. Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns for a bold, statement-making look.</p><h3>Embrace Retro Silhouettes</h3><p>The 60's were known for their unique silhouettes, including A-line dresses, mini skirts, and bell-bottom pants. Look for pieces that have a retro feel, but with a modern twist. For example, you could pair a mini skirt with a graphic t-shirt or a bell-bottom pant with a fitted top.</p><h3>Accessorize with Vintage Pieces</h3><p>If you're not ready to fully commit to a 60's-inspired wardrobe, you can still incorporate vintage pieces into your look. Look for vintage accessories like statement earrings, oversized sunglasses, or a vintage handbag. These pieces can add a touch of retro charm to any outfit.</p><h2>FAQ About 60's Fashion</h2><h3>What Was the Most Popular Style in the 60's?</h3><p>The mod style was the most popular style in the 60's. The mod movement emerged in London, and its influence quickly spread throughout the world. Mod fashion was all about clean lines, bold patterns, and bright colors.</p><h3>What Were the Most Popular Fabrics in the 60's?</h3><p>The most popular fabrics in the 60's were natural fibers like cotton, wool, and linen. These fabrics were lightweight, breathable, and perfect for the casual, bohemian styles that were popular at the time.</p><h2>Hair Care in the 60's</h2><p>Hair was a big part of 60's fashion, and there were several iconic hairstyles that emerged during the decade. Here are some of the most popular styles:</p><h3>The Bouffant</h3><p>The bouffant was a popular hairstyle in the early 60's. It involved teasing the hair at the crown of the head to create a high, rounded shape. This style was often paired with a headband or a scarf.</p><h3>The Beehive</h3><p>The beehive was another popular hairstyle in the 60's. It was similar to the bouffant, but with a more conical shape. This style was often worn by women in the mod scene.</p><h3>The Shag</h3><p>The shag was a popular hairstyle in the late 60's. It involved cutting the hair into layers and adding texture for a messy, carefree look. This style was often worn by women in the hippie scene.</p><p>No matter what type of clothes you choose to wear, remember that fashion is all about self-expression. Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and have fun with your wardrobe.</p></article>
