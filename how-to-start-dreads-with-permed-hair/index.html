This can make starting dreadlocks a bit more challenging, but it is still possible. Starting dreads with permed hair requires patience and proper hair care to avoid damage and breakage.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Start Dreads with Permed Hair</h3><p>Before starting the dreadlocking process, it's important to note that permed hair is fragile and may break easily. It's recommended that you wait at least six months after getting a perm before starting dreadlocks. This allows your hair to recover from the chemical treatment and grow out a bit, making it more resilient.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Here are the steps to follow when starting dreads with permed hair:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair. Shampoo and condition your hair, then let it air dry completely.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections. Using a comb, create sections of hair that are about an inch wide. Secure each section with a hair tie or clip.</li><li>Backcomb each section. Starting at the roots, use a fine-toothed comb to backcomb each section of hair. This creates knots and tangles that will eventually form into dreadlocks.</li><li>Twist each section. After backcombing, twist each section of hair in the same direction until it tightens into a coil.</li><li>Maintain your dreads. As your hair grows, continue to twist and maintain your dreadlocks.

This will help your dreadlocks form and stay in place without leaving behind buildup or residue.</li><li>Avoid over-twisting. Over-twisting your dreads can cause damage and breakage, so be gentle when maintaining them.</li><li>Protect your hair at night. Wear a silk or satin bonnet or scarf to prevent your dreads from rubbing against cotton pillowcases, which can cause frizz and breakage.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about starting dreads with permed hair:</p><ul><li><strong>Can I start dreads with freshly permed hair?</strong> It's not recommended to start dreadlocks immediately after getting a perm.
