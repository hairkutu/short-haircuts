Here are some tips for controlling men's wavy hair:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Products</h3><p>The right products can make a huge difference when it comes to controlling wavy hair.

Use a low heat setting and gently scrunch your hair with the diffuser to enhance your natural waves.</p><h3>4. Avoid Overwashing</h3><p>Wavy hair can be prone to dryness, so avoid overwashing your hair. Wash your hair every other day or every two days to help maintain its natural oils. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that are designed for wavy hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to controlling men's wavy hair:</p><h3>1.
