You want a style that flatters your face and accentuates your best features. That's why we've put together a guide to the best short haircuts for heart-shaped faces in 2020. Keep reading to find out which styles will work best for you.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A heart-shaped face is characterized by a wider forehead, high cheekbones, and a narrow chin. The goal of a good haircut for this face shape is to balance out these features and create a more symmetrical look. Short haircuts are a great option for heart-shaped faces because they draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones while minimizing the width of the forehead.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The first step in finding the right short haircut for your heart-shaped face is to consider your hair texture. If you have fine hair, a layered bob or pixie cut can add volume and movement. If you have thick hair, a blunt bob or shaggy pixie can help to thin out your hair and create a more manageable style.</p><p>Next, consider the length of your hair. A short haircut can be anywhere from a daring pixie to a chin-length bob. The key is to find a length that flatters your face shape and highlights your best features. A layered bob is a great option for heart-shaped faces because it adds volume to the crown while minimizing the width of the forehead.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1. Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are designed for your hair type. <br/>2. Blow-dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and shape. <br/>3. Use a flat iron or curling iron to create waves or curls, depending on your desired look. <br/>4. Apply a styling product, such as mousse or hair wax, to help hold your style in place. <br/>5. Finish with a hairspray to add shine and hold.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>When choosing a short haircut for your heart-shaped face, it's important to consider your lifestyle and how much time you want to spend styling your hair each day. A pixie cut may be low-maintenance, but it may not be the best choice if you have a busy schedule and need a style that can be worn in different settings.</p><p>Another tip is to choose a haircut that complements your personal style. If you prefer a more edgy look, a choppy pixie or asymmetrical bob may be a great choice. If you prefer a more classic look, a sleek bob or blunt cut may be more your style.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I still wear bangs with a short haircut?</strong><br/>A: Yes, you can definitely wear bangs with a short haircut. However, it's important to choose the right type of bangs for your face shape. For a heart-shaped face, side-swept bangs or long, wispy bangs are a great choice because they help to balance out the width of the forehead.</p><p><strong>Q: Will a short haircut make my face look too round?</strong><br/>A: No, a short haircut can actually help to elongate your face and create a more balanced look. The key is to choose a style that flatters your face shape and highlights your best features.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>When it comes to maintaining your short haircut, regular trims are key. Depending on the length of your hair, you may need to visit the salon every 4-8 weeks to keep your style looking fresh.</p><p>It's also important to use high-quality hair care products that are designed for your hair type. This can help to keep your hair healthy and prevent damage from heat styling and environmental factors.</p><p>In conclusion, there are many great short haircuts for heart-shaped faces in 2020. By considering your hair texture, length, and personal style, you can find a style that flatters your face shape and highlights your best features. With regular trims and high-quality hair care products, you can maintain your short haircut and keep it looking great all year long.</p></article>
