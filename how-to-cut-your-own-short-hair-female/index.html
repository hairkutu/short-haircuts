You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, hair clips, and a handheld mirror.

Make sure it's completely dry, as wet hair can appear longer and can lead to uneven cuts. Part your hair in the middle, and clip one side away.</p><h3>Sectioning Your Hair</h3><p>Starting on the unclipped side, use the comb to create a vertical parting at the back of your head. Hold the section of hair between your index and middle fingers, and cut the hair to your desired length. Repeat this process, moving forward and upward, until you reach the crown of your head.</p><p>Once you've finished one side, unclip the other side and repeat the process. Make sure to match the length of the hair on both sides.</p><h3>Trimming the Bangs</h3><p>If you have bangs, start by combing them straight down.
