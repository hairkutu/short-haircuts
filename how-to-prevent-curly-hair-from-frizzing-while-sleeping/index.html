Use a Silk or Satin Pillowcase</h3><p>Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase can cause friction and breakage on curly hair, leading to frizz. Silk or satin pillowcases are much gentler on hair and can help prevent tangles and frizz. If you don’t want to invest in a new pillowcase, you can also wrap your hair in a silk scarf or bonnet before bed.</p><h3>2. Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Before going to bed, apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair. This can help lock in moisture and prevent frizz. Be sure to focus on the ends of your hair, where dryness and frizz are most common.</p><h3>3. Pineapple Your Hair</h3><p>Pineappling is a technique where you gather your hair on top of your head in a loose ponytail, resembling a pineapple. This can help preserve your curls and prevent them from getting flattened while you sleep. You can use a scrunchie or a silk hair tie to secure the pineapple.</p><h3>4. Use a Curl Refresher</h3><p>If you wake up with flattened curls, use a curl refresher to bring them back to life. Simply spritz your hair with the curl refresher and scrunch your curls back into shape. This can help revive your curls and prevent frizz.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to prevent curly hair from frizzing while sleeping:</p><ol><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair.</li><li>Gather your hair on top of your head in a loose ponytail, resembling a pineapple.</li><li>Use a curl refresher if needed.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help prevent curly hair from frizzing while sleeping:</p><ul><li>Avoid using cotton towels to dry your hair.
