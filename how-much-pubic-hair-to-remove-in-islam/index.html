One aspect of personal hygiene that is often overlooked is the removal of pubic hair. For both men and women, the question of how much pubic hair to remove in Islam can be a sensitive topic. In this guide, we will explore the Islamic perspective on pubic hair removal, how to remove it, and some tips for hair care.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>In Islam, pubic hair removal is considered a matter of personal hygiene and cleanliness. It is recommended for both men and women to remove pubic hair regularly. The amount of hair to remove varies depending on the individual's preferences and cultural norms.
