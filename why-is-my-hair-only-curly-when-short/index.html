You're not alone! Many people experience this phenomenon and are left scratching their heads as to why it happens. In this article, we'll explore the science behind why your hair is only curly when short and how to care for it properly.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>Before we dive into the reasons why your hair is only curly when short, let's first define what we mean by "short." Typically, hair that falls above the shoulders is considered short. The reason why your hair is curly when short has to do with the weight of your hair. When your hair is shorter, it's lighter and bouncier, which allows your curls to form more easily. However, as your hair grows longer, the weight of your hair pulls your curls down, causing them to straighten out.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The good news is that you can still achieve curly hair even if your hair is longer than shoulder-length. Here are some tips on how to encourage your curls:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Invest in hair products specifically designed for curly hair. Look for products that are sulfate-free and contain ingredients like shea butter and argan oil, which provide moisture and definition to your curls.</p><h3>2. Scrunch Your Hair</h3><p>After washing your hair, scrunch it with a towel to encourage your curls to form. Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, as this can cause frizz and damage.</p><h3>3. Apply Products While Hair Is Wet</h3><p>Apply your styling products while your hair is still wet. This helps to distribute the products evenly and ensures that your curls are defined from root to tip.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve curly hair:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair.</p><h3>2. Apply Styling Products</h3><p>While your hair is still wet, apply a curl-defining cream or gel to your hair. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>3. Scrunch Your Hair</h3><p>Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to scrunch your hair. This helps to encourage your curls to form.</p><h3>4. Diffuse Your Hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This helps to maintain your curls while adding volume to your hair.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for achieving curly hair:</p><h3>1. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons, as they can damage your hair and cause your curls to fall flat.</p><h3>2. Sleep with a Silk Pillowcase</h3><p>Sleeping on a silk pillowcase can help to prevent frizz and keep your curls intact.</p><h3>3. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends, which can weigh down your curls.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Why does my hair only curl when short?</h3><p>A: When your hair is shorter, it's lighter and bouncier, which allows your curls to form more easily.

Protect your hair by wearing a hat or using a heat protectant spray before heat styling.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, your hair is only curly when short due to the weight of your hair.
