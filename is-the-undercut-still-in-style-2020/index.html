The answer is yes! The undercut is still a trendy and stylish haircut that can be customized to fit your personal style. This hairstyle is characterized by short sides and back with longer hair on top, creating a sharp contrast between the two lengths.</p><p>The undercut is a versatile haircut that can be worn in a variety of ways, from slicked-back to messy and textured.

Start by washing your hair with a good shampoo and conditioner. This will help to remove any excess oil and dirt from your hair and make it easier to style.</p><p>2.
