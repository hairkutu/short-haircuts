Accutane can cause hair loss in several ways:</p><ul><li>It can cause the hair to become dry and brittle, leading to breakage and shedding.</li><li>It can disrupt the normal growth cycle of hair follicles, leading to hair loss.</li><li>It can cause an increase in sebum production, which can clog hair follicles and prevent hair from growing.</li></ul><p>Once you've identified the cause of your hair loss, you can take steps to address the problem.
