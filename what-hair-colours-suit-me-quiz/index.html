If you have cool undertones, choose cool colours like ash blonde or jet black.</li><li>Think about your lifestyle. If you're someone who's always on the go, a low-maintenance colour like balayage or highlights may be a better choice than a full head of colour.</li><li>Don't choose a colour based on trends.

However, it's important to follow the instructions carefully and use high-quality products to avoid damaging your hair.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>Whether you're changing your hair colour or sticking with your current shade, it's important to take care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that are suitable for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as it can strip it of its natural oils.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using heat styling tools.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Consider using a hair mask once a week to nourish your hair.</li></ul><p>By following these tips, you can keep your hair looking healthy and shiny.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Taking a "What Hair Colours Suit Me Quiz" can be a fun and helpful way to find your perfect shade.
