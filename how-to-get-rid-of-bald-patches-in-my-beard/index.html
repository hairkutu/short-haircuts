Here are a few of the most effective treatments:</p><ul><li><strong>Minoxidil:</strong> This over-the-counter medication is typically used to treat hair loss on the scalp, but it can also be effective for beard hair growth.

Look for one that contains ingredients like argan oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin E.</li><li><strong>Proper nutrition:</strong> Eating a healthy diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote hair growth. Focus on eating plenty of protein, fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats.</li><li><strong>Micro-needling:</strong> This procedure involves using a small roller with tiny needles to create micro-injuries on the skin.
