One of the biggest struggles for people with curly hair is getting volume on top. If you have curly hair, you know that it's easy for your hair to fall flat, leaving you with a lifeless, limp style. Fortunately, there are several ways to get volume on top of curly hair. In this article, we'll share some tips and tricks to help you achieve the voluminous curly hair of your dreams.</p><h2>How to Get Volume on Top of Curly Hair</h2><h3>1. Use a Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>The first step in getting volume on top of curly hair is to use the right shampoo and conditioner. Look for products that are specifically designed to add volume to hair. These products will help to lift your hair at the roots, giving it more body and bounce.</p><h3>2. Apply Mousse to Damp Hair</h3><p>After washing your hair, apply a volumizing mousse to your damp hair. Use a golf ball-sized amount of mousse and work it through your hair, focusing on the roots. This will help to add volume and hold to your curls.</p><h3>3. Use a Diffuser When Blow-Drying</h3><p>When blow-drying your hair, use a diffuser attachment to help enhance your curls and add volume. Hold the diffuser close to your scalp and move it around to dry all areas of your hair. This will help to lift your hair at the roots and create more volume.</p><h3>4. Tease Your Hair</h3><p>If you're looking for even more volume, try teasing your hair. Take small sections of hair and backcomb them using a fine-toothed comb. This will create volume and texture, making your hair look fuller.</p><h3>5. Use Hair Extensions</h3><p>If you're looking for a more drastic change, you can use hair extensions to add volume to your hair. Clip-in extensions are easy to use and can be applied at home. You can also opt for more permanent extensions, such as tape-in or sew-in extensions.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Volume on Top of Curly Hair</h2><p>Follow these steps to get volume on top of curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Mousse to Damp Hair</h3><p>Apply a golf ball-sized amount of volumizing mousse to your damp hair.

Gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it with a scrunchie or hair tie. This will help to prevent your curls from getting flattened while you sleep.</p><h3>Tip 3: Avoid Over-Washing Your Hair</h3><p>Over-washing your hair can strip it of its natural oils, leaving it dry and limp.
