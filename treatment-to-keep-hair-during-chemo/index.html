These caps are worn before, during, and after chemotherapy treatment. The caps work by constricting blood vessels in the scalp, reducing the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach the hair follicles. This method has shown to be effective in minimizing hair loss during chemotherapy.</p><h3>Topical Minoxidil</h3><p>Topical minoxidil is a medication used to stimulate hair growth. It is applied directly to the scalp and can be used during chemotherapy to help keep hair. Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles, which can help stimulate hair growth. This treatment is most effective for people with mild to moderate hair loss.</p><h3>Low-Level Laser Therapy</h3><p>Low-level laser therapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses red light to stimulate hair growth. This treatment is applied to the scalp using a special device. The red light is believed to increase blood flow to the hair follicles, which can help stimulate hair growth. This treatment is most effective for people with mild to moderate hair loss.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you are considering using scalp cooling caps, here is a step-by-step guide:</p><ol><li>Before chemotherapy treatment, wash your hair and scalp thoroughly.</li><li>Put on the cooling cap before the chemotherapy drugs are administered.</li><li>Wear the cooling cap during the entire chemotherapy treatment.</li><li>After chemotherapy treatment, continue to wear the cooling cap for an additional 30 minutes to an hour.</li><li>Remove the cooling cap and wash your hair and scalp thoroughly.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Keeping Hair During Chemo</h2><p>Here are some tips to help keep hair during chemo:</p><ul><li>Avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair, such as hair dyes or relaxers.</li><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair.</li><li>Avoid using heat on your hair, such as blow dryers and curling irons.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair.</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles, such as braids and ponytails.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or scarf.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can scalp cooling caps cause headaches?</h3><p>Scalp cooling caps can cause headaches in some people.
