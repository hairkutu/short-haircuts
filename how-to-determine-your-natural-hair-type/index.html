There are four main hair types: straight, wavy, curly, and coily. Each type has its own unique characteristics and requires different care and styling techniques. Knowing your hair type will help you choose products that work best for your hair and avoid damage caused by using the wrong products and techniques.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Hair Type</h2><p>To determine your hair type, you'll need to examine the shape of your hair strands. The easiest way to do this is to take a single strand of hair and examine it closely. Here are the four main hair types:</p><h3>Straight Hair</h3><p>Straight hair is characterized by hair strands that are completely straight from root to tip. Straight hair is usually shiny and reflects light easily. It can be difficult to hold a curl and may become oily quickly.</p><h3>Wavy Hair</h3><p>Wavy hair is characterized by hair strands that form an "S" shape. It is not completely straight but not curly either. Wavy hair is usually thicker and may be more prone to frizz. It can hold a curl better than straight hair.</p><h3>Curly Hair</h3><p>Curly hair is characterized by hair strands that are tightly coiled and form a spiral shape. It can be difficult to comb or brush and may become frizzy easily. Curly hair may also be prone to dryness.</p><h3>Coily Hair</h3><p>Coily hair is characterized by hair strands that are tightly coiled and form a zigzag or "Z" pattern. It is the most fragile hair type and may break easily. Coily hair is also prone to dryness and may require more moisture than other hair types.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to determining your hair type:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair as you normally would.</li><li>Gently towel dry your hair.</li><li>Take a single strand of hair from the top of your head.</li><li>Examine the shape of the strand:</li><ul><li>If the strand is completely straight, you have straight hair.</li><li>If the strand forms an "S" shape, you have wavy hair.</li><li>If the strand forms a spiral shape, you have curly hair.</li><li>If the strand forms a zigzag or "Z" shape, you have coily hair.</li></ul></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Determining Your Hair Type</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you determine your hair type:</p><ul><li>Examine your hair when it's wet and dry.

For example, you may have wavy hair on top and curly hair on the bottom. In this case, you'll need to use different products and techniques for each hair type.</p><h3>Can my hair type change over time?</h3><p>Yes, your hair type can change over time due to hormonal changes, aging, and other factors. It's important to regularly assess your hair type and adjust your hair care routine as needed.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Your Hair Type</h2><p>Once you've determined your hair type, it's important to choose products and treatments that work best for your hair.
