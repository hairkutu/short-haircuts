If your hair is fine and easily weighed down, look for a lightweight formula. If your hair is thick and tends to be dry, look for a richer formula.</li><li>Consider your hair's needs.

Using too much can weigh down the hair and make it look greasy. Start with a small amount and add more if needed.</p><h4>Q: How often should I use leave in conditioner?</h4><p>A: This will depend on your hair's needs.
