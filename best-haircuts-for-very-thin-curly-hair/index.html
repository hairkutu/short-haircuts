If you have a square face, a side-swept fringe can help soften your features. </p><p> Finally, you'll want to think about your personal style. Are you more of a classic or modern person? Do you like bold, edgy haircuts or something more subtle? By taking all of these factors into consideration, you'll be able to choose a haircut that suits you perfectly. </p><h2> The Best Haircuts for Very Thin Curly Hair </h2><h3> 1.
