Barber Tutorial YouTube</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking to learn how to cut men's hair scissor over comb, you've come to the right place. This technique is widely used by barbers and hairdressers to create a classic, textured look that's popular with men of all ages. In this post, we'll take you through the steps to achieve a perfect scissor over comb haircut.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Scissor over comb is a classic cutting technique that involves using a pair of scissors to cut hair while holding a comb in the other hand. This technique is often used to create a tapered or textured look, and it can be used on all hair types and lengths. Scissor over comb is a popular technique in men's haircuts, as it allows for precise cutting and control over the hair.</p><h2>How to Cut Men's Hair Scissor Over Comb</h2><h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3><p>Before starting, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of sharp hairdressing scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water. It's also a good idea to have a mirror in front of you and a cape or towel to protect your client's clothes.</p><h3>Step 2: Sectioning</h3><p>Start by sectioning the hair into manageable sections. Use the comb to create a parting, and then clip the hair up and out of the way. Start at the nape of the neck and work your way up, section by section.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb and Cut</h3><p>Take a section of hair and comb it straight out from the head. Hold the comb horizontally, and place the scissors at the bottom of the comb, pointing upwards. Cut across the comb, moving upwards towards the head. Repeat this process for each section, cutting the hair to the desired length.</p><h3>Step 4: Blending</h3><p>Once you've cut all the sections, it's time to blend the hair. Use the same technique, but this time, hold the comb vertically and cut diagonally across the hair. This will blend the layers and create a seamless, natural look.</p><h3>Step 5: Finishing</h3><p>After you've finished cutting, use a comb and scissors to trim any stray hairs. You can also use clippers to create a more defined look around the edges. Finish off by styling the hair with gel or pomade, if desired.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Make sure your scissors are sharp, as dull scissors can damage the hair and create split ends.</li><li>Use a spray bottle to keep the hair damp, as it's easier to cut and style when wet.</li><li>Take your time and be patient. Scissor over comb is a technique that requires practice and skill.</li><li>Consult with your client before you start cutting, and make sure you understand their desired look.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the difference between scissor over comb and clipper cutting?</h3><p>Scissor over comb involves using a pair of scissors to cut hair while holding a comb in the other hand, while clipper cutting involves using an electric clipper to cut hair to a specific length. Scissor over comb is often used for creating a textured or tapered look, while clipper cutting is used for creating a more uniform look.</p><h3>Can scissor over comb be used on all hair types?</h3><p>Yes, scissor over comb can be used on all hair types and lengths. It's a versatile technique that allows for precise cutting and control over the hair.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After you've cut your client's hair, it's important to advise them on how to care for it. Recommend a good shampoo and conditioner, and suggest they avoid using too much heat on their hair. Trimming the hair regularly can also help maintain the style and keep it looking neat and tidy.</p><p>Cutting men's hair scissor over comb can be a rewarding experience, and with practice, you can master this classic technique. Remember to take your time, use the right tools, and consult with your client before you start cutting. With these tips and techniques, you'll be on your way to creating a perfect scissor over comb haircut.</p></article>
