It's a natural biological process that happens typically when a woman is in her late 40s or early 50s.

Estrogen is responsible for promoting hair growth, while progesterone helps to keep hair on the scalp. As the levels of these hormones decrease, women may notice thinning hair, dryness, and brittleness. But what about body hair? </p><p>Body hair growth is influenced by androgen hormones, such as testosterone. Women do produce testosterone, but in lower levels than men.

Here are some tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Wash your hair regularly:</strong> Wash your hair every 2-3 days to prevent build-up and maintain a healthy scalp. </li><li><strong>Use a gentle shampoo:</strong> Choose a shampoo that is free from harsh chemicals and sulfates. </li><li><strong>Avoid heat styling:</strong> Heat styling tools can damage your hair, so use them sparingly. </li><li><strong>Trim your hair regularly:</strong> Regular trims can help to prevent split ends and promote healthy hair growth. </li></ul><p>In conclusion, menopause can cause hormonal fluctuations that can affect hair growth and texture.
