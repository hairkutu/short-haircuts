If you have a square or round face, a shorter cut with some texture on top can help balance out your features. If you have an oval or heart-shaped face, you can go for a shorter or longer cut with more volume.</p><p>Next, think about the texture of your hair. If your hair is very curly, you may want to consider a shorter cut that will allow your curls to spring up naturally. If your hair is more wavy than curly, a longer cut may work better for you.</p><p>Finally, consider your lifestyle and how much time you're willing to spend styling your hair each day. If you're always on the go, a shorter, low-maintenance cut may be the best option for you.</p><h2>Popular Short Haircuts for Guys with Thick Curly Hair</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right haircut, let's take a look at some popular short haircuts for guys with thick curly hair:</p><h3>The Buzz Cut</h3><p>The buzz cut is a classic short haircut that works well for guys with thick curly hair.
