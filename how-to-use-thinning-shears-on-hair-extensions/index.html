They are used to remove bulk from hair and create texture, which is why they are often used on hair extensions too. However, if you're new to using thinning shears, you might be unsure about how to use them properly on hair extensions.

For example, if you have clip-in extensions, you cannot use thinning shears on them as they are not attached to your natural hair. However, if you have sew-in or bonded extensions, you can use thinning shears on them.</p><p>Thinning shears are used to remove bulk from hair, so they are especially useful if you have thick hair extensions. They work by cutting some of the hair strands while leaving others intact. This creates a textured, layered look that is perfect for those who want to add volume to their hair.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h3><p>Follow these steps to use thinning shears on hair extensions:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and drying your hair extensions.

Clip the top section of your hair extensions away from the bottom section.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the bottom section and comb it straight down. This will help you see the length of the hair and identify the areas where you need to remove bulk.</li><li>Hold the thinning shears with the teeth facing upwards and the blades facing downwards. Cut into the hair at a 45-degree angle, starting from the middle of the hair strand and working your way downwards. Make sure to cut only a few strands at a time to avoid cutting too much hair.</li><li>Continue cutting into the hair until you have removed the desired amount of bulk.

However, you can use thinning shears on sew-in or bonded extensions.</p><h4>Can I use regular scissors instead of thinning shears?</h4><p>You can use regular scissors to cut your hair extensions, but they will not create the same textured, layered look that thinning shears do. Thinning shears are specifically designed to remove bulk and create texture, so they are the best tool for the job.</p><h4>How often should I use thinning shears on my hair extensions?</h4><p>This depends on how quickly your hair extensions grow and how often you wear them. As a general rule, you should use thinning shears on your hair extensions every 6-8 weeks to maintain their shape and prevent them from looking too bulky.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Hair Extensions</h2><p>Here are some general hair care tips to keep in mind when you have hair extensions:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to prevent your hair extensions from drying out.</li><li>Avoid using hot styling tools on your hair extensions as they can damage the hair.</li><li>Brush your hair extensions gently with a wide-tooth comb or a special hair extension brush to prevent tangling.</li><li>Avoid sleeping with wet hair extensions as this can cause them to tangle.</li><li>Don't use too much product on your hair extensions as this can weigh them down and make them look greasy.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and using thinning shears properly, you can maintain the health and appearance of your hair extensions and achieve the textured, layered look you desire.</p></article>
