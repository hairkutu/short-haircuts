But don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we will share some of the best hairstyles that will flatter your face shape and complement your glasses. From short to long hair, we've got something for everyone. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A square face shape is characterized by a strong jawline, a broad forehead, and angular cheekbones. If you wear glasses, it's important to choose a hairstyle that balances your facial features and doesn't clash with your frames. The right hairstyle can help soften your features, enhance your natural beauty, and boost your confidence. Whether you prefer a classic or trendy look, there are plenty of options to choose from.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hairstyle</h2><p>Before we dive into the best hairstyles for over 60 square face and glasses, let's talk about how to choose the right hairstyle for you. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, if you have a square face shape, you want to choose a hairstyle that softens your features. Avoid blunt cuts or harsh layers that can make your face look even more angular. Instead, opt for soft, wispy layers and side-swept bangs that will frame your face and add some movement.</p><h3>Think About Your Glasses</h3><p>Your glasses are an important part of your overall look, so you want to make sure your hairstyle complements them. If you have bold, statement frames, you may want to choose a more understated hairstyle that doesn't compete with them. On the other hand, if you have more subtle frames, you can be a bit more adventurous with your hairstyle.</p><h3>Consider Your Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture can also influence the type of hairstyle that will work best for you. If you have fine hair, you may want to choose a hairstyle with some volume and texture to add some fullness. If you have thick hair, you may want to opt for a sleek, layered cut that will help tame your locks.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Hairstyles for Over 60 Square Face and Glasses</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right hairstyle for you, let's take a look at some of the best options for over 60 square face and glasses:</p><h3>Short Hair</h3><p>Short hair can be a great option if you want an easy, low-maintenance style that still looks chic and stylish. Here are some of the best short hairstyles for over 60 square face and glasses:</p><ul><li>Pixie Cut: This classic short hairstyle is perfect for square face shapes. It features short, choppy layers that add volume and texture.

It's easy to maintain and can be styled straight or wavy depending on your mood. Pair it with round glasses for a classic, retro vibe.</li><li>Cropped Cut: If you want to really embrace your square face shape, a cropped cut is a great option. This ultra-short style features a buzzed or shaved cut that highlights your bone structure. Pair it with rectangular glasses for a modern, edgy look.</li></ul><h3>Medium Hair</h3><p>If you prefer a longer style, medium hair can be a great option. Here are some of the best medium hairstyles for over 60 square face and glasses:</p><ul><li>Layered Lob: This shoulder-length cut features soft, wispy layers that frame your face and add some movement. It's a great option if you want a low-maintenance style that still looks chic and stylish. Pair it with oval glasses for a sophisticated look.</li><li>Shoulder-Length Bob: This classic bob is a great option if you want a timeless, elegant look. It features a blunt cut with subtle layers that add some texture.

They add some volume and movement to your hair without sacrificing length. Pair them with round glasses for a fun, bohemian vibe.</li></ul><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle</h2><p>Once you've chosen your perfect hairstyle, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips for maintaining your hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use the right products for your hair type</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends</li><li>Avoid heat styling tools as much as possible</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine</li><li>Invest in a good quality brush or comb</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best hairstyle for a square face with glasses?</h3><p>The best hairstyle for a square face with glasses is one that softens your features and complements your frames.
