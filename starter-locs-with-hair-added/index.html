This hairstyle is a great way to get the look of dreadlocks without having to wait for your hair to naturally lock up. In this article, we will provide you with a complete guide on how to get starter locs with hair added.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Starter locs with hair added, also known as “instant locs,” involve adding extensions to your hair to create the appearance of dreadlocks. This technique is ideal for people with straight or loosely curled hair who want to achieve the look of locs without waiting months or even years for their hair to lock up naturally. </p><h2>How to Get Starter Locs with Hair Added</h2><p>If you are interested in getting starter locs with hair added, here are the steps you should follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Extensions</h3><p>The first step in getting starter locs with hair added is to choose the type of extensions you want to use. You can use synthetic or human hair extensions, and they come in a variety of textures and colors. Choose extensions that closely match your natural hair texture and color for the most natural look.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Before you begin adding extensions, you should wash and condition your hair to remove any product buildup or oils. This will ensure that your hair is clean and ready to be styled.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, you should section your hair into small, even sections using a rat-tail comb. The sections should be about the size of the extension you plan to use. </p><h3>Step 4: Add Extensions</h3><p>Starting at the root of each section, add the extension hair to your natural hair using a crochet hook. The crochet hook will pull the extension hair through your natural hair, creating a loop. Then, you will pull the ends of the extension hair through the loop and tighten it to secure the extension in place. </p><h3>Step 5: Twist the Hair</h3><p>Once the extension hair is secured in place, you will need to twist the hair to create the appearance of dreadlocks. Take two strands of hair, one natural and one extension, and twist them together in a clockwise direction. Continue twisting until the hair begins to lock up.</p><h3>Step 6: Maintain Your Starter Locs</h3><p>Once your starter locs are in place, you will need to maintain them to keep them looking their best. This involves regular washing and conditioning, as well as retwisting the hair every few weeks. </p><h2>Tips for Getting Starter Locs with Hair Added</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when getting starter locs with hair added:</p><ul><li>Choose high-quality extensions to ensure that they look natural and last a long time.</li><li>Wash and condition your hair regularly to keep your starter locs looking fresh.</li><li>Be gentle when handling your starter locs to avoid damaging your natural hair.</li><li>Retwist your starter locs regularly to keep them looking neat and tidy.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long does it take to get starter locs with hair added?</h3><p>The process of adding extensions and creating starter locs can take several hours depending on the length and thickness of your hair.</p><h3>How long do starter locs with hair added last?</h3><p>With proper care and maintenance, starter locs with hair added can last for several months to a year or more.</p><h3>Can I color my starter locs with hair added?</h3><p>You should avoid coloring your starter locs with hair added, as the chemicals can damage the extensions and cause them to unravel.</p><h2>Hair Care for Starter Locs with Hair Added</h2><p>To keep your starter locs with hair added looking their best, you should follow a regular hair care routine that includes washing and conditioning your hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner to keep your hair and extensions healthy and hydrated. You should also avoid using heavy styling products that can weigh down your hair and cause buildup.</p><p>Now that you know how to get starter locs with hair added, you can achieve the look of dreadlocks without waiting for your hair to naturally lock up. Follow these tips and techniques to keep your starter locs looking their best for months to come.</p></article>
