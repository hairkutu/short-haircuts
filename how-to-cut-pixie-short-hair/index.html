You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section your hair. </p><h2 id="section2"> Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Pixie Short Hair </h2><p> Now that you've prepared your hair, it's time to start cutting your pixie short hair. Follow these steps to get the perfect haircut: </p><h3> 1. Section Your Hair </h3><p> Use hair clips to section your hair into four parts: the top, right side, left side, and back. This will make it easier to cut your hair evenly. </p><h3> 2. Cut the Back </h3><p> Start by cutting the back of your hair. Use your comb to separate a small section of hair at the nape of your neck.

Cut the Sides </h3><p> Once you've cut the back, move on to the sides. Use your comb to separate a small section of hair at the temple. Hold your hair between your fingers and cut it at an angle, following the curve of your head. Repeat on the other side. </p><h3> 4. Cut the Top </h3><p> Finally, it's time to cut the top of your hair. Use your comb to separate a section of hair at the crown of your head. Hold your hair between your fingers and cut it to your desired length.
