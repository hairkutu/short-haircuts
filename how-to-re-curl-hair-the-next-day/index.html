Hold for 5-10 seconds and release. Repeat until you have curled all of your hair. </p><h3>Step 5: Add Volume</h3><p>To add volume to your curls, use a teasing brush to lightly tease the roots of your hair. This will create a more voluminous look.</p><h3>Step 6: Apply Hairspray</h3><p>Finish off by applying hairspray to your curls to hold them in place. </p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to ensure that your curls last longer:</p><ul><li>Use a high-quality curling iron</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair before going to bed</li><li>Sleep with your hair in a loose bun or braid to prevent frizz</li><li>Use a satin pillowcase to prevent hair breakage</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about re curling hair the next day:</p><h3>Can I re-curl my hair without a curling iron?</h3><p>Yes, you can use hot rollers or flexi rods to re-curl your hair.
