That’s because square faces have strong jawlines and angular features, which means you need a haircut that softens those features and brings out the best in your face shape. In this article, we’ll be discussing the most flattering haircuts for square faces, including how to get them, tips for styling them, and how to take care of your hair.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#haircuts">Most Flattering Haircuts for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Styling Tips for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#care">Hair Care for Square Faces</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>The first step in finding the most flattering haircut for your square face is to determine your face shape. To do this, stand in front of a mirror and pull your hair back off your face. Look at the shape of your face and compare it to the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Square:</strong> Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width.</li><li><strong>Round:</strong> Your face is widest at the cheeks and has soft, rounded features.</li><li><strong>Oval:</strong> Your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead is slightly wider than your jawline.</li><li><strong>Heart:</strong> Your forehead is wider than your jawline, and your face comes to a point at your chin.</li><li><strong>Diamond:</strong> Your face is widest at the cheekbones, and your forehead and jawline are both narrower.</li></ul><br/><h2 id="haircuts">Most Flattering Haircuts for Square Faces</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it’s time to choose a haircut that flatters your square face. Here are some of the most flattering haircuts for square faces:</p><h3>Long Layers</h3><p>If you have long hair, adding layers can help soften your features and add movement to your hair. Long layers that start at your chin or collarbone are particularly flattering for square faces.</p><h3>Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can help soften your forehead and draw attention away from your strong jawline. They also add movement to your hair and can be styled in a variety of ways.</p><h3>Bob</h3><p>A bob that hits just below your chin can help balance out your strong jawline. Soft, textured bobs are particularly flattering for square faces.</p><h3>Layered Pixie</h3><p>If you have short hair, a layered pixie cut can help soften your features and draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones. This cut works particularly well for square faces with sharp features.</p><h3>Wavy Lob</h3><p>A wavy lob (long bob) can help soften your features and add volume to your hair. This cut works particularly well for square faces with thick hair.</p><br/><h2 id="tips">Styling Tips for Square Faces</h2><p>Once you have the right haircut, it’s important to style it in a way that flatters your square face. Here are some tips for styling your hair:</p><ul><li>Add volume to the top of your hair to balance out your strong jawline.</li><li>Avoid center parts, as they can make your face look even more angular.</li><li>Experiment with different parting styles to see what works best for your face shape.</li><li>Avoid hairstyles that are too slicked back or severe, as they can accentuate your strong features.</li><li>Use volumizing products to add body and movement to your hair.</li></ul><br/><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What if I have curly hair?</h3><p>If you have curly hair and a square face, you can still rock many of the same haircuts as those with straight hair. Just be sure to work with a stylist who knows how to cut curly hair and can help you find the right style for your face shape.</p><h3>What if I have thin hair?</h3><p>If you have thin hair and a square face, you can still achieve a flattering haircut by adding layers and texture. A textured bob or layered pixie can help add volume and movement to your hair.</p><h3>What if I want to keep my hair long?</h3><p>If you want to keep your hair long, adding layers can help soften your features and add movement to your hair. Long layers that start at your chin or collarbone are particularly flattering for square faces.</p><br/><h2 id="care">Hair Care for Square Faces</h2><p>Once you have the right haircut, it’s important to take care of your hair to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips for keeping your hair healthy:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every other day to avoid stripping it of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair too often, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray when using hot tools.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Avoid using too many styling products, as they can weigh down your hair.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and choosing the right haircut, you can flatter your square face and feel confident in your hair.</p></article>
