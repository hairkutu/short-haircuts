Here are the steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wet the Hair</h3><p>Spray the hair with water to make it damp. This will help the hair to be more manageable and easier to cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Section the Hair</h3><p>Use the comb to divide the hair into sections. Section the top of the hair from the sides and back. Clip the sections up to keep them out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting the Sides</h3><p>Start with the sides, using the comb to lift the hair to the desired length. Use the scissors to cut the hair, starting from the bottom and working your way up. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Unclip the top section and comb it straight up. Use the scissors to cut the hair to the desired length. Work from the front to the back, using the first cut as a guide for the rest of the hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Blend the hair by using the scissors to cut the hair at an angle. This will help to create a smooth transition between the different lengths of hair.</p><h3>Step 6: Trim the Bangs</h3><p>Trim the bangs to the desired length, using the scissors to cut the hair straight across.
