Here are some factors to consider:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>Just like any other haircut, the shape of your face plays a vital role in the kind of haircut that will suit you. Generally, boys with curly hair should opt for haircuts that add some length to their face shape. If you have a round face, you may want to avoid haircuts that are too short on the sides and top, as they can make your face look wider. On the other hand, if you have a square-shaped face, you can go for a more defined and structured haircut.</p><h3>Hair Type</h3><p>Curly hair comes in different types, from loose waves to tight coils. The kind of haircut you choose should complement your hair type. For instance, if you have loose curls, you can opt for a layered haircut that adds volume and movement to your hair. If you have tight curls, a shorter haircut may be more suitable to prevent your hair from looking too bulky.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Your haircut should also be practical and easy to maintain, especially if you're an active boy. If you spend a lot of time outdoors or playing sports, you may want to go for shorter haircuts that require less styling and upkeep.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Cutting Curly Hair Boy</h2><p>Cutting curly hair is different from cutting straight hair.
