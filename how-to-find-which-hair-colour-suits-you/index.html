There are two main categories of skin tone: warm and cool. If you have warm undertones, your skin will have a yellow, golden or peachy hue. If you have cool undertones, your skin will have a pink, red or bluish hue.</p><p>There are a few ways to determine your skin tone:</p><ul><li>Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they appear green, you have warm undertones. If they appear blue, you have cool undertones.</li><li>Hold up a piece of silver jewellery and a piece of gold jewellery to your face. If the gold makes you look brighter and more alive, you have warm undertones. If the silver is more flattering, you have cool undertones.</li><li>Look at the colour of your eyes. If you have warm undertones, your eyes will be brown, hazel or green. If you have cool undertones, your eyes will be blue, grey or green.</li></ul><h2 id="step2"> Step 2: Consider Your Eye Colour </h2><p>Your eye colour can also play a role in determining which hair colour will suit you best. Here are a few general guidelines:</p><ul><li>If you have blue eyes, warm tones like caramel or honey are flattering.</li><li>If you have green eyes, red or auburn shades can complement your eye colour.</li><li>If you have brown eyes, almost any hair colour can work, but warm tones like copper or chocolate can be particularly flattering.</li></ul><h2 id="step3"> Step 3: Think About Your Natural Hair Colour </h2><p>Your natural hair colour can also be a helpful starting point when choosing a new hair colour. Here are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li>If you have light blonde hair, consider shades like platinum, ash blonde or baby blonde.</li><li>If you have dark blonde hair, consider shades like honey or caramel.</li><li>If you have light brown hair, consider shades like chestnut or golden brown.</li><li>If you have dark brown hair, consider shades like chocolate or espresso.</li><li>If you have black hair, consider shades like blue-black or jet black.</li></ul><h2 id="step4"> Step 4: Consult with a Professional </h2><p>Once you've done some research and have a general idea of what you're looking for, it's always a good idea to consult with a professional stylist. A stylist can help you determine which shades will work best with your skin tone and can also give you tips on how to maintain your new hair colour.</p><h2 id="tips"> Tips for Choosing the Right Hair Colour </h2><ul><li>Consider your lifestyle.

In this case, you may want to experiment with different shades to find what works best for you.</p><h3> Will a drastic hair colour change require a lot of maintenance? </h3><p>It depends on the shade and the natural colour of your hair. If you're going from blonde to black, for example, you may need to touch up your roots every few weeks. Talk to your stylist about the maintenance requirements of the shade you're considering.</p><h3> Can I dye my hair myself? </h3><p>While it's possible to dye your hair at home, we recommend consulting with a professional stylist.
