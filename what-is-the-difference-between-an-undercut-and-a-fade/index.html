For an undercut, simply apply a small amount of pomade or styling cream to the longer hair on top and style as desired.

You can also add a small amount of pomade to help hold the style in place.</p><h2 id="tips-for-maintaining-an-undercut-or-fade">Tips for Maintaining an Undercut or Fade</h2><p>To keep your undercut or fade looking great, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, be sure to get regular trims to maintain the shape and length of your haircut. Second, use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and clean.
