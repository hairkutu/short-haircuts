Here's how you can achieve this look:</p><h3>Step 1: Grow Out Your Hair</h3><p>The first step in achieving TikTok boy hair is to let your hair grow out. You'll need at least 4-6 inches of hair on top to get the right length and texture.</p><h3>Step 2: Get the Right Haircut</h3><p>Once your hair has grown out, it's time to get a haircut. Make sure to ask your hairstylist for a layered cut with longer hair on top and shorter sides. The layers will help create texture, and the shorter sides will add contrast to the longer top.</p><h3>Step 3: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Now that you have the right haircut, it's time to style your hair. Start by applying a small amount of hair product, such as a texturizing spray or pomade, to your hair. Use your fingers to work the product through your hair, creating texture and volume. You can also use a hairdryer to add more volume and shape to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once you've styled your hair, finish it off with a light mist of hairspray to hold the look in place. You don't want too much hairspray, or it will weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Styling and Maintaining TikTok Boy Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for styling and maintaining your TikTok boy hair:</p><h3>Tip 1: Don't Wash Your Hair Every Day</h3><p>Washing your hair every day can strip it of its natural oils and make it look dry and dull.
