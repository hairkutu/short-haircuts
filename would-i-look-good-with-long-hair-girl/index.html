Long hair can be difficult to maintain if you have thick, curly hair, while those with fine, straight hair may find that longer lengths make their hair look limp and lifeless.</p><p>Finally, think about your lifestyle. Long hair requires more maintenance than shorter styles, so if you're someone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend on your hair, you may want to opt for a shorter cut.
