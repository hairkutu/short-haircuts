It's a versatile cut that works well for both men and women, and it's easy to style and care for. But what exactly is a grade 3 haircut, and how can you achieve it? In this article, we'll answer all your questions about what size is a grade 3 haircut in mm and provide some tips on how to style and care for this trendy haircut.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Before we dive into the specifics of what size is a grade 3 haircut in mm, let's first define what a grade 3 haircut is. A grade 3 haircut is a clipper cut that leaves your hair 3/8 inch or 9.5 mm long. It's a medium-length haircut that's longer than a grade 2 and shorter than a grade 4. This haircut is also known as a "number 3" or "3 guard" haircut because it's achieved using a clipper guard with the number 3 on it.</p><h2>How to Achieve a Grade 3 Haircut</h2><p>If you want to achieve a grade 3 haircut, you'll need a pair of clippers with a guard that has the number 3 on it. Here's how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Towel dry your hair or let it air dry completely before you start cutting.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Guard</h3><p>Choose a clipper guard with the number 3 on it. Attach the guard to your clippers.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Start cutting your hair from the sides and back, moving the clippers against the direction of hair growth. Use a mirror to check the length and make sure you're cutting evenly. Once you've finished the sides and back, move on to the top of your head. Cut your hair in the direction of hair growth, and use scissors to trim any longer hairs that stick out.</p><h3>Step 4: Clean Up</h3><p>Use a comb and scissors to clean up the edges and make sure your hair is even. If you want a more tapered look, use a smaller clipper guard around the ears and at the nape of your neck.</p><h2>Tips for Styling and Maintaining a Grade 3 Haircut</h2><p>Now that you know what size is a grade 3 haircut in mm and how to achieve it, here are some tips for styling and maintaining your new haircut:</p><ul><li>Use a styling product to add texture and hold to your hair.</li><li>Visit your barber or stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim to maintain the length and shape of your haircut.</li><li>Wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like blow dryers and straighteners too often, as they can damage your hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about what size is a grade 3 haircut in mm:</p><h3>What's the difference between a grade 2 and a grade 3 haircut?</h3><p>A grade 2 haircut is shorter than a grade 3 and leaves your hair 1/4 inch or 6.35 mm long.

Scissors can be used to trim any longer hairs that stick out, but they can't achieve the same length and evenness as clippers.</p><h3>What face shapes suit a grade 3 haircut?</h3><p>A grade 3 haircut is a versatile haircut that suits most face shapes. It works particularly well for people with round, oval, or heart-shaped faces.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Finally, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips for maintaining healthy hair:</p><ul><li>Eat a balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals.</li><li>Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.</li><li>Avoid using harsh chemicals or styling products that can damage your hair.</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends and promote healthy hair growth.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what size is a grade 3 haircut in mm and how to achieve it, you can confidently rock this trendy and easy-to-maintain haircut.
