There are six basic face shapes - round, oval, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. Each face shape has certain features that can be enhanced or softened with the right haircut. </p><p>Once you've determined your face shape, consider your hair texture. Is your hair straight, wavy, curly, or coily? Different hair textures require different haircuts to look their best. For example, if you have curly hair, you may want to opt for a layered cut to enhance your curls, while those with straight hair may prefer a blunt cut for a sleek look. </p><p>Next, think about your personal style. Do you prefer a classic, timeless look or a more trendy, edgy style? Your haircut should reflect your personal style and make you feel confident and comfortable. </p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>1.
