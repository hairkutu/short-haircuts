In this tutorial, we'll go through the step-by-step process of how to cut men's hair long on top with scissors. We'll also provide you with some tips and tricks that will help you achieve the perfect cut every time.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The long-on-top hairstyle has been a popular trend among men for years. It's a classic haircut that is versatile, easy to style, and looks great on almost everyone. This hairstyle is characterized by longer hair on the top of the head, with shorter sides and back. It's a great option for men who want to keep their hair long but don't want to deal with the maintenance that comes with having long hair all over.</p><h2>How to Cut Men's Hair Long on Top with Scissors</h2><p>Before you start cutting, it's important to have the right tools. You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water. Here's how to cut men's hair long on top with scissors:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>The first step is to wash and dry the hair. This will make it easier to cut and style. Use a shampoo and conditioner that are suited to your hair type, and make sure to rinse thoroughly. Once you've washed your hair, dry it completely with a towel or blow dryer.</p><h3>Step 2: Comb the Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a comb to detangle it. Start at the bottom and work your way up, making sure to comb through each section thoroughly.</p><h3>Step 3: Section the Hair</h3><p>Next, section the hair by separating the top from the sides and back. Use a comb to create a part that runs from the center of the forehead to the back of the head. Clip the sides and back away from the top using hair clips.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Starting at the front of the head, use your scissors to cut the hair on the top. Hold the section of hair between your fingers and cut it to the desired length. Repeat this process for each section of hair on the top of the head, working your way towards the back.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Sides and Back</h3><p>Once you've cut the top, it's time to blend the sides and back. Use your scissors to trim the hair on the sides and back, gradually blending it into the longer hair on top. Make sure to blend the hair evenly so that it looks natural.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for Evenness</h3><p>After you've cut and blended the hair, check for evenness. Use your comb to comb through the hair and check for any uneven spots. If you find any, trim them until the hair looks even.</p><h3>Step 7: Style the Hair</h3><p>Once you're happy with the length and shape of the haircut, it's time to style the hair. You can use a hair product like pomade or wax to add texture and hold to the hair. Apply the product to your hands and work it through the hair, starting at the roots and working your way up.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect long-on-top haircut:</p><ul><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Take your time and be patient.</li><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid damaging the hair.</li><li>Blend the hair on the sides and back gradually to avoid any harsh lines.</li><li>Check for evenness regularly throughout the cutting process.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I cut my own hair long on top?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair long on top with scissors. However, it's important to be patient and take your time. It's also a good idea to have someone help you, especially if this is your first time cutting your own hair.</p><h3>How long should the hair be on top?</h3><p>The length of the hair on top will depend on your personal preference. However, a good rule of thumb is to leave 2-3 inches of hair on top.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After you've cut your hair, it's important to take care of it properly. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo and conditioner that are suited to your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like blow dryers and straighteners too often.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to keep it looking neat and tidy.</li><li>Use a hair product like pomade or wax to add texture and hold to the hair.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to cut men's hair long on top with scissors, you can achieve that stylish, trendy look that you've been wanting.
