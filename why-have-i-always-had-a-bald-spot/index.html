Here are some of the most common causes:</p><h3>1. Genetics</h3><p>If baldness runs in your family, it is possible that you inherited the gene responsible for hair loss. This type of hair loss is called androgenic alopecia and can affect both men and women.</p><h3>2. Alopecia Areata</h3><p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes hair to fall out in patches. This condition can affect people of all ages and can cause bald spots to appear on the scalp.</p><h3>3. Nutritional Deficiencies</h3><p>If you are not getting enough nutrients in your diet, your hair may suffer. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to hair loss and bald spots.</p><h3>4.

These medications work by increasing blood flow to the scalp and promoting hair growth.</p><h3>2. Hair Transplants</h3><p>If you have a large bald spot, a hair transplant may be the best option. During a hair transplant, hair follicles are taken from a donor area and transplanted to the bald spot.</p><h3>3.
