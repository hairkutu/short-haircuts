Instead, wash your hair every other day or every few days.</p><p>When you do wash your hair, apply a small amount of shampoo to your scalp and massage it in gently. Don't rub your hair vigorously, as this can cause breakage and frizz.

The shampoo will run down your hair and cleanse it as it goes.</li><li>Don't use too much shampoo, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li></ul><h2 id="tips-for-hair-care">Tips for Hair Care</h2><p>Curly hair requires a little extra care and attention to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips for hair care:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons or curling irons, as these can damage your hair and cause frizz.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to your hair after washing it to help lock in moisture and prevent frizz.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause breakage and frizz.
