Hair loss in cats can be caused by several factors, including allergies, infections, parasites, or stress. Understanding the underlying cause of your cat's hair loss is crucial to determine the appropriate treatment and ensure your cat's overall health and well-being.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair loss around the ears is a common issue among cats. The hair on the ears is relatively thin, and it's prone to falling out due to various factors. Hair loss can occur on the outer ear, inner ear, or both.

If you notice any of these symptoms, it's crucial to seek veterinary care to prevent further complications.</p><h2>How to Determine the Cause of Hair Loss?</h2><p>If you notice hair loss around your cat's ears, the first step is to determine the underlying cause.
