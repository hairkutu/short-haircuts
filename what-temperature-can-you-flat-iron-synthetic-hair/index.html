Synthetic hair is made from various types of plastic fibers, so the heat tolerance is much lower than natural hair. However, with the right tools and techniques, you can still achieve a sleek, straight look without damaging your synthetic hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Synthetic hair is a popular alternative to natural hair for many reasons. It's affordable, easy to maintain, and comes in a variety of colors and styles. However, when it comes to heat styling, synthetic hair requires special care to avoid melting or burning. </p><h2>How To Flat Iron Synthetic Hair</h2><p>Before flat ironing your synthetic hair, it's important to make sure it's clean and dry. Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair, and let it air dry completely. Once your hair is dry, brush it out to remove any tangles or knots.</p><p>Next, apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair. This will help protect your hair from heat damage and make it easier to straighten. Divide your hair into small sections using hair clips or rubber bands.</p><p>Set your flat iron to a low or medium heat setting. Most synthetic hair can be safely flat ironed between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. It's best to start with a lower temperature and gradually increase it if necessary. </p><p>Take one section of hair and clamp it between the flat iron plates. Slowly glide the flat iron down the length of your hair, making sure to keep it moving to avoid overheating any one spot. Repeat this process until all of your hair is straightened.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>1. Wash your synthetic hair with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. </p><p>2.
