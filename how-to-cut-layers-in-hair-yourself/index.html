It's best to cut hair when it's dry, as wet hair can stretch and make it difficult to achieve an even cut.</li><li>Comb your hair straight and divide it into sections. Use sectioning clips or hair ties to keep each section separate.</li><li>Determine the length of your layers. Decide how many layers you want and where you want them to start. For a subtle look, start your layers around the jawline. For a more dramatic look, start your layers higher up.</li><li>Begin cutting. Take one section of hair at a time and hold it straight up. Use your hair-cutting scissors to cut a small amount at a time. Start at the ends and work your way up. Be sure to cut at an angle to achieve a layered look.</li><li>Continue cutting.
