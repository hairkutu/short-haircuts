Chemotherapy is a treatment that targets rapidly dividing cells in the body, including cancer cells. Unfortunately, hair follicle cells also divide rapidly, which means that they can be affected by chemotherapy drugs.</p><p>If you are undergoing chemotherapy, you may be wondering if you will definitely lose your hair. The answer is not straightforward, as it depends on the specific chemotherapy drugs you are receiving, the dosage, and your individual response to treatment.</p><p>However, it is important to be prepared for the possibility of hair loss and to know what to expect. In this article, we will provide tips on how to prepare for hair loss, steps to take if you experience hair loss, and how to care for your hair during and after chemotherapy.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Prepare for Hair Loss</h2><p>If you are undergoing chemotherapy and are worried about hair loss, there are steps you can take to prepare yourself:</p><h3>1.
