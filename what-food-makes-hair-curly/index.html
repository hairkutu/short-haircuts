While genetics play a significant role in determining the texture of your hair, your diet can also affect its appearance.</p><p>Eating a balanced diet that includes foods rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth and enhance your natural curls. In this guide, we'll be discussing what food makes hair curly and how you can incorporate them into your diet.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>If you're looking to enhance your natural curls, you'll need to incorporate the right foods into your diet.

Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Washing your hair regularly can help keep it clean and healthy. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>2.
