However, choosing the right haircut is crucial to make the most of your natural texture. In this article, we will discuss the best haircuts for naturally wavy hair medium length. </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium length haircuts are perfect for wavy hair as they allow you to show off your natural texture while keeping the length manageable. Wavy hair tends to be voluminous, so a medium length haircut will help balance the volume, making it more manageable to style. </p><h2>How to Choose the Right Haircut?</h2><p>Choosing the right haircut for your wavy hair can be tricky, but here are some tips that can help:</p><h3>Consider your Face Shape</h3><p>The right haircut should complement your face shape. For instance, if you have a round face, a layered haircut that falls below your chin will help elongate your face. On the other hand, if you have a heart-shaped face, a choppy bob that falls below your ears will complement your features. </p><h3>Consider the Texture of your Hair</h3><p>Your natural hair texture should also play a role in the haircut you choose. If you have thick wavy hair, a layered haircut will help create movement and reduce the weight of your hair. On the other hand, if you have fine wavy hair, a blunt cut will help create the illusion of volume. </p><h3>Consider your Lifestyle</h3><p>Lastly, consider your lifestyle when choosing the right haircut. If you have a busy lifestyle, a low maintenance haircut like a long bob will be perfect for you. On the other hand, if you have more time to style your hair, a shaggy layered haircut will add more dimension to your hair. </p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling your Medium Length Wavy Hair</h2><p>Now that you have chosen the right haircut, here is a step-by-step guide to styling your medium length wavy hair: </p><h3>Step 1: Wash your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for wavy hair. This will help enhance your natural texture and make your hair more manageable. </p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product like a mousse or a curl defining cream to damp hair. This will help define your waves and reduce frizz. </p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry your Hair</h3><p>Blow dry your hair using a diffuser attachment. This will help enhance your natural waves while reducing frizz. </p><h3>Step 4: Add Finishing Touches</h3><p>Add finishing touches like a sea salt spray or a texturizing spray to add more definition to your waves. </p><h2>Tips for Maintaining your Wavy Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your wavy hair: </p><h3>Avoid Brushing your Hair when it is Dry</h3><p>Brushing your hair when it is dry can cause frizz and breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair when it is wet. </p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling Tools</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can damage your hair over time. Instead, embrace your natural texture and use a diffuser attachment when blow drying your hair. </p><h3>Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Wavy hair tends to be dry, so it is important to use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated and healthy. </p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the Best Haircut for Naturally Wavy Hair Medium Length?</h3><p>The best haircut for naturally wavy hair medium length is a layered haircut that falls between your shoulders and your collarbone. This will help add movement to your hair while keeping it manageable. </p><h3>How Often Should I Wash my Wavy Hair?</h3><p>You should wash your wavy hair every two to three days to avoid drying it out. </p><h3>Can I Use a Straightening Iron on my Wavy Hair?</h3><p>While you can use a straightening iron on your wavy hair, it is not recommended as it can damage your hair over time. Instead, embrace your natural texture and use a diffuser attachment when blow drying your hair. </p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Wavy hair requires special care to keep it healthy and manageable. Here are some hair care tips for wavy hair: </p><h3>Use a Shampoo and Conditioner that is Specifically Designed for Wavy Hair</h3><p>Using a shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for wavy hair will help enhance your natural texture and keep your hair hydrated. </p><h3>Avoid Using Hot Water</h3><p>Hot water can strip your hair of its natural oils, so it is important to use lukewarm water when washing your hair. </p><h3>Use a Wide-Tooth Comb to Detangle your Hair</h3><p>Avoid using a brush to detangle your hair as it can cause breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair when it is wet. </p><h3>Avoid Overwashing your Hair</h3><p>Overwashing your hair can strip it of its natural oils, causing it to become dry and brittle. Instead, wash your hair every two to three days. </p><p>In conclusion, choosing the right haircut for your naturally wavy hair medium length is crucial to make the most of your natural texture. Follow the tips and steps mentioned in this article to achieve the perfect wavy hairstyle. </p></article>
