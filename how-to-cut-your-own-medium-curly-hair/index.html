This will help you see how your curls fall naturally and give you a better idea of how much hair you want to cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using your comb or brush, section your hair into four quadrants: two in the front and two in the back. Clip or tie each section of hair with an elastic band or hair clip.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Back</h3><p>With your back facing the mirror, take down one of the back sections of hair. Using your comb, separate a small piece of hair from the bottom of the section, and use your scissors to cut it to the desired length. Continue doing this, working your way up the section of hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Move to the Front</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the back section, move on to the front. Take down one of the front sections of hair and repeat the same process, cutting small pieces of hair to the desired length.</p><h3>Step 5: Check Your Progress</h3><p>After you've finished cutting all four sections of hair, use your mirrors to check your progress. Make any additional cuts or adjustments as needed.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Your Own Hair</h2><ul><li>Start with small cuts and work your way up to the desired length.</li><li>Don't try to cut too much hair at once. It's better to take your time and make small cuts, rather than trying to cut a lot of hair all at once.</li><li>Use hair clips or elastic bands to section your hair. This will make it easier to see what you're doing and prevent you from accidentally cutting the wrong section of hair.</li><li>Use sharp scissors specifically designed for cutting hair.

However, if you prefer to cut your hair when it's wet, just keep in mind that your hair will shrink as it dries, so you may want to cut it slightly longer than you normally would.</p><h3>How often should I cut my curly hair?</h3><p>It depends on your hair type and how quickly it grows. As a general rule, most people with curly hair should get a trim every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends.</p><h3>What should I do if I make a mistake while cutting my hair?</h3><p>If you make a mistake while cutting your hair, don't panic! Depending on the severity of the mistake, you may be able to fix it by making small adjustments. If it's a major mistake, you may need to visit a professional stylist to have it corrected.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care After Cutting Your Own Hair</h2><p>After you've finished cutting your hair, it's important to take good care of it to keep it healthy and looking great. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, which can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, rather than a brush.</li><li>Avoid using products that contain alcohol, which can dry out your hair.</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you should be able to cut your own medium curly hair with confidence. Remember to take your time, start with small cuts, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Happy cutting!</p></article>
