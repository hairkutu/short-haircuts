Additionally, exposure to environmental factors such as sun, wind, and pollution can also contribute to changes in hair texture over time.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Take Care of Your Hair as You Age</h2><p>The key to taking care of your hair as you age is to be gentle with it. Avoid using harsh chemicals and heat styling tools, as these can further damage your hair and make it more prone to breakage. Instead, opt for natural hair care products and gentle styling techniques.</p><p>You may also want to consider changing your diet to include more foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals that are essential for healthy hair, such as biotin, vitamin C, and iron.
