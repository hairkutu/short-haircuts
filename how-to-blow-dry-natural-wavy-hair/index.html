In this article, we'll go through everything you need to know about blow drying natural wavy hair, including tips, step-by-step instructions, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Blow Dry Natural Wavy Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Blow Drying Natural Wavy Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Natural Wavy Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Blow Dry Natural Wavy Hair</h2><p>Before we get into the specifics of how to blow dry natural wavy hair, it's important to know that the process will vary depending on your hair type, length, and texture. However, the following general steps can be applied to most types of natural wavy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that's designed for wavy hair. After washing, gently pat your hair dry with a towel to remove excess water. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair to protect it from heat damage. This will also help to reduce frizz and flyaways.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using hair clips. This will make it easier to blow dry and ensure that all sections are evenly dried.</p><h3>Step 4: Choose Your Blow Dryer</h3><p>Choose a high-quality blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. A diffuser will help to distribute heat evenly and enhance your natural waves.</p><h3>Step 5: Start Blow Drying</h3><p>Start blow drying your hair on a low heat setting, using the diffuser attachment. Hold the diffuser close to your head and cup your hair in the diffuser, gently scrunching as you go. Continue this process until your hair is about 80% dry.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with High Heat</h3><p>Once your hair is about 80% dry, switch to a high heat setting and continue blow drying. Use your fingers to scrunch your hair as you go, and focus on the areas that need extra attention. Be careful not to over-dry your hair, as this can cause frizz.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Now that we've gone through the general steps for blow drying natural wavy hair, let's break it down into a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that's designed for wavy hair.
