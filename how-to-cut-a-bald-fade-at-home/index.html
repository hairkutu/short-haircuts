Wet hair can be harder to cut, and you don't want to slip with your clippers. Put on your haircutting cape or towel to catch the hair that falls.</p><p>Next, attach the #1 guard to your clippers and start buzzing the sides of your head. Go against the grain, from the bottom to the top, until you have a uniform length all around. Don't worry about the top for now.</p><h3 id="step2">Step 2: Buzz the Sides</h3><p>Now, switch to the #2 guard and start creating the fade. Start below the temple and go halfway up the side of your head. Use an upward motion to blend the shorter hair with the longer hair on top. Repeat on the other side.</p><p>Switch to the #3 guard and repeat the process, starting lower than before and going up to the temple. Again, use an upward motion to blend the hair. Repeat on the other side.</p><p>Finally, switch to the #4 guard and go just above the ear, using the same upward motion to blend the hair. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3 id="step3">Step 3: Create the Fade</h3><p>Now that you have the fade on the sides, it's time to blend it with the top. Take off the guard from your clippers and use the bare blades to create a seamless transition between the sides and the top. Use a comb to lift the hair and cut it with the scissors. Take your time and make sure it looks even.</p><h3 id="step4">Step 4: Blend the Top and Sides</h3><p>Next, use your trimmer to clean up the hairline around your ears and neck. Use the longest guard to avoid cutting too much hair. Then, go over the sides and back of your head with the trimmer to make sure it's all even.</p><h3 id="step5">Step 5: Clean Up</h3><p>Finally, take a shower and wash your hair to get rid of any loose hair. Use a towel to dry your hair and style it as you like.

As a general rule, you should cut your hair every 4-6 weeks.</p><h3>Q: Can I cut my own hair without a mirror?</h3><p>A: It's not recommended, as you won't be able to see the back of your head and may end up with an uneven cut.</p><h2 id="haircare">Hair Care After Cutting a Bald Fade</h2><p>After cutting your hair, it's important to take good care of it to keep it healthy and looking good.
