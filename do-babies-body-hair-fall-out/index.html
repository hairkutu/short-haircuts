This is because the hair is only temporary and is not the same as the hair that grows on the scalp. The hair on the body is known as lanugo, and it is very fine and soft. Lanugo begins to grow on the fetus at around 16 weeks of gestation and is typically shed before birth. However, some babies are born with lanugo still present on their body.</p><p>It is not uncommon for newborn babies to have a fine layer of hair covering their body, especially premature babies. This hair will eventually fall out on its own and will be replaced with thicker, pigmented hair. However, the timing of when this happens can vary from baby to baby.</p><h2 id="sec2">Why Do Babies Have Body Hair?</h2><p>The body hair that babies are born with, known as lanugo, serves a purpose while in the womb. It helps to regulate the baby's body temperature and protects their skin while they are developing. However, once a baby is born, they no longer need the lanugo as their body is able to regulate its temperature on its own.</p><p>Another reason why babies have body hair is due to genetics. Some babies are born with more body hair than others, and this is simply due to their genetic makeup.</p><h2 id="sec3">When Do Babies Body Hair Fall Out?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the timing of when babies' body hair falls out can vary. Some babies may lose their lanugo hair in the womb or shortly after birth, while others may keep it for a few weeks or even months. Typically, the hair will fall out on its own and will be replaced with thicker, pigmented hair.</p><p>It is important to note that if your baby's body hair is not falling out or if you notice an excessive amount of hair, you should consult with your pediatrician.</p><h2 id="sec4">How to Take Care of Your Baby's Hair?</h2><p>While babies' body hair is temporary and will fall out on its own, it is still important to take care of it. Here are some tips on how to take care of your baby's hair:</p><ul><li>Use a mild baby shampoo to wash your baby's hair</li><li>Be gentle when washing and combing your baby's hair</li><li>Avoid using adult hair products on your baby</li><li>Do not use hot styling tools on your baby's hair</li></ul><h2 id="sec5">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Should I be concerned if my baby's body hair is not falling out?</h3><p>A: If your baby's body hair is not falling out or if you notice an excessive amount of hair, you should consult with your pediatrician.</p><h3>Q: When will my baby's hair on their scalp start to grow?</h3><p>A: Typically, a baby's hair on their scalp will start to grow within the first 3 months of life.</p><h3>Q: Can I use regular shampoo on my baby's hair?</h3><p>A: It is recommended to use a mild baby shampoo on your baby's hair as adult shampoos can be too harsh for their delicate scalp.</p><h3>Q: Can I use conditioner on my baby's hair?</h3><p>A: It is not necessary to use conditioner on your baby's hair as it is very fine and soft. However, if you choose to use conditioner, make sure it is a mild baby conditioner.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my baby's hair?</h3><p>A: It is recommended to wash your baby's hair 2-3 times a week.</p><p>Overall, babies' body hair does fall out eventually, and it is nothing to be concerned about.
