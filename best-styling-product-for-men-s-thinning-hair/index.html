Desired Style</h3><p>The second factor to consider is the style you want to achieve. Do you want a slicked-back look, a messy textured look, or a natural-looking style? Different styling products are designed to achieve different styles, so choose one that will help you achieve your desired look.</p><h3>3. Hold and Texture</h3><p>The third factor to consider is the hold and texture of the styling product. Do you want a strong hold that will keep your hair in place all day, or a light hold that will allow your hair to move naturally?

Then, apply it to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way to the ends. Use your fingers to style your hair as desired.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Once you have styled your hair, finish with a light hairspray to hold it in place.
