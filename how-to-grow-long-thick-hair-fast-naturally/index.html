Scalp Massage</h3><p>Massaging your scalp regularly can stimulate hair growth by increasing blood circulation to the hair follicles.

Massage gently in circular motions for 10-15 minutes and then wash your hair with a mild shampoo.</p><h3>2. Onion Juice</h3><p>Onion juice is rich in sulfur, which can boost collagen production and promote hair growth. To use onion juice for hair growth, take a few onions and extract their juice.

Aloe Vera</h3><p>Aloe vera is a natural conditioner that can nourish your hair and promote hair growth. Simply extract the gel from an aloe vera leaf and apply it to your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 30 minutes and then rinse your hair with water. Repeat this process once a week for best results.</p><h3>4. Egg Mask</h3><p>Eggs are rich in protein and biotin, which are essential for hair growth. To make an egg mask, beat an egg and apply it to your hair and scalp.
