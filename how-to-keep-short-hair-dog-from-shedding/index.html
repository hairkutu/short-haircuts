Use a grooming brush to remove loose fur from your dog's coat. Brush your dog at least once a week, or more often if your dog sheds excessively. You can also use a de-shedding tool to remove excess fur.</p><h3>Proper Nutrition</h3><p>Your dog's diet can affect shedding. A diet that is high in omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce shedding. Look for dog food that contains fish oil or flaxseed oil. You can also add a fish oil supplement to your dog's food.</p><h3>Regular Exercise</h3><p>Regular exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety in your dog, which can contribute to shedding. Take your dog for a walk or play fetch in the backyard. A tired dog is a happy dog.</p><h3>Stress Reduction</h3><p>Stress can cause your dog to shed more than usual. Reduce stress by providing a comfortable and safe environment for your dog. Give your dog a quiet place to rest, away from loud noises and other stressors.</p><h3>Supplements</h3><p>There are supplements available that can help reduce shedding.
