Vellus hair is usually barely noticeable, but some people might want to remove it for cosmetic reasons.</p><p>So, does shaving vellus hair make it thicker? The answer is no. Shaving vellus hair does not make it grow back thicker, darker, or coarser. This is because vellus hair is different from terminal hair in terms of texture, color, and growth cycle.</p><p>When you shave vellus hair, you're only cutting the hair shaft at the surface of the skin.

You don't need any special equipment or skills, and you can do it at home.
