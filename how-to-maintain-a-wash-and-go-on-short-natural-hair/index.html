You can also use a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to add moisture and definition to your curls.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product, such as a gel or curl defining cream, to your hair while it's still damp. Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Define Your Curls</h3><p>Use a Denman brush, a comb or your fingers to define your curls. Make sure to separate each curl and smooth out any frizz or flyaways. You can also use a diffuser to dry your hair, but make sure to use a low heat setting to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Let Your Hair Dry</h3><p>Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser to dry your hair. Avoid touching your hair while it's drying to prevent frizz.</p><h3>Step 5: Refresh Your Curls</h3><p>Refresh your curls on the second or third day by spritzing your hair with water or a leave-in conditioner and scrunching your hair.
