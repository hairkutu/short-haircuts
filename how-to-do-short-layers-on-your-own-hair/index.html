You should have two sections on either side of your head.</li><li>Start with one of the back sections. Use your comb to tease a small section of hair near the crown of your head. This will help you see where your shortest layer will be.</li><li>Use your shears to cut the hair at the teased section. Start with a small amount and continue to cut until you reach your desired length.</li><li>Move on to the next section. Use the previously cut section as a guide for the length of your next section. Cut the hair at the same length as the previous section.</li><li>Continue cutting each section, making sure to match the length of the previous section. When you reach the front sections, make sure to angle the cuts towards your face.</li><li>Once you've cut all the sections, use your comb to blend the layers together.
