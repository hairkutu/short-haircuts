If you have long hair, you might wonder if you can still wear a short wig without it being noticeable. The answer is yes, you can wear a short wig with long hair. However, there are a few things you need to consider to make it look natural and comfortable.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Wear a Short Wig with Long Hair</h2><p>The key to wearing a short wig with long hair is to make sure your natural hair is as flat and secure as possible. You don't want any bumps or lumps that might make the wig look unnatural or uncomfortable. Here are a few tips on how to do it:</p><h3>1. Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Braiding your hair is a great way to make it flat and secure. You can do one or multiple braids, depending on the length and thickness of your hair. Make sure the braids are close to your scalp so that the wig sits flat on your head.</p><h3>2. Use a Wig Cap</h3><p>A wig cap is a thin, stretchy cap that fits over your head and hair. It helps to keep your hair flat and in place, and also provides a barrier between your scalp and the wig. You can find wig caps at most beauty supply stores or online.</p><h3>3. Secure the Wig</h3><p>Once you have your hair braided and a wig cap on, it's time to put on the wig. Make sure the wig is centered on your head and secure it with the combs or clips that come with it. You can also use bobby pins to secure it further.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're new to wearing wigs, here's a step-by-step guide on how to wear a short wig with long hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Before braiding your hair and putting on the wig cap, make sure your hair is clean and conditioned.
