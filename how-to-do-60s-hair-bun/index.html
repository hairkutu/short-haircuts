Look no further than the 60s hair bun! This iconic hairstyle was popularized by famous celebrities like Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot, and it continues to be a popular choice for those who want to add a vintage touch to their look.</p><p>In this article, we’ll guide you through the process of creating a 60s hair bun, from start to finish. We’ll also provide you with some tips and tricks to make the process easier and answer some frequently asked questions about this hairstyle.</p><h2>How to Create a 60s Hair Bun: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s how you can create a 60s hair bun in just a few simple steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and blow-drying it until it’s completely dry. Apply some hair mousse to your hair to give it some texture and hold. You can also use a curling iron to create loose waves if you want to add some extra volume to your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, part your hair in the middle and divide it into two equal sections. Brush each section to make sure it’s smooth and free of tangles.</p><h3>Step 3: Create a Ponytail</h3><p>Tie each section into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck. Make sure the ponytails are even in length and position.</p><h3>Step 4: Twist and Pin</h3><p>Take one of the ponytails and twist it until it forms a tight rope-like shape. Wrap the twisted ponytail around the base of the ponytail to create a bun. Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place. Repeat the process with the other ponytail.</p><h3>Step 5: Finishing Touches</h3><p>Once you’ve created both buns, use some hairspray to hold them in place. You can also use a hair accessory like a ribbon or a headband to add some extra flair to your look.</p><h2>Tips for Creating a 60s Hair Bun</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you create the perfect 60s hair bun:</p><ul><li>Use bobby pins that match the color of your hair to hide them better.</li><li>Apply hairspray to your hair before you start to give it some extra hold.</li><li>Use a hair donut to create a bigger bun.</li><li>Tease the crown of your hair to add some extra volume to your look.</li><li>Don’t worry if your bun is not perfectly symmetrical – the slightly messy look is part of the charm of this hairstyle.</li></ul><h2>FAQ: 60s Hair Bun</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the 60s hair bun:</p><h3>What hair type works best for a 60s hair bun?</h3><p>A 60s hair bun works best for medium to long hair that’s not too thick or too thin.
