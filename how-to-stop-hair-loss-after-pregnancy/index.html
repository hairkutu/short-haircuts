This condition is caused by the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the hormone estrogen causes hair to remain in the growth phase, resulting in thicker, fuller hair.

This shedding can occur up to three months after giving birth and can last for several months. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Stop Hair Loss After Pregnancy</h2><p>There are several steps you can take to stop hair loss after pregnancy. </p><h3>1.
