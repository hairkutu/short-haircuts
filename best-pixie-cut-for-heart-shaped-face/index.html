This facial structure is characterized by a broad forehead, high cheekbones, and a narrow chin. Many women with this face shape often struggle to find the perfect hairstyle that flatters their features. A pixie cut can be a great option, but it's important to choose the right style that complements your face shape.

Heart-shaped faces tend to look best with styles that balance out their features. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><h3>1. Play Up Your Cheekbones</h3><p>Your high cheekbones are one of your best assets, so choose a style that accentuates them. Opt for a pixie cut with volume on top or side-swept bangs that highlight your cheekbones.</p><h3>2.

A longer, layered pixie or a side-parted style can help balance out your features.</p><h3>3.
