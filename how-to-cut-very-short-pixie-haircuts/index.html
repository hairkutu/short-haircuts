This trendy and edgy cut can be customized to suit your face shape and personal style, and it's surprisingly easy to maintain. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of cutting a very short pixie haircut, from choosing the right length to finishing touches.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#section1">Choosing the Right Length</a></li><li><a href="#section2">Tools You'll Need</a></li><li><a href="#section3">Preparing Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#section4">Cutting the Sides</a></li><li><a href="#section5">Cutting the Top</a></li><li><a href="#section6">Trimming the Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#section7">Adding Texture</a></li><li><a href="#section8">Finishing Touches</a></li><li><a href="#section9">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#section10">Hair Care Tips</a></li></ul><h3 id="section1">Choosing the Right Length</h3><p>The first step in cutting a very short pixie haircut is choosing the right length. This will depend on your face shape, hair texture, and personal style. Generally, very short pixie haircuts are around 1-2 inches long on the sides and back, with longer layers on top. However, you can customize the length to suit your preferences.</p><p>Some things to consider when choosing the length of your pixie haircut include:</p><ul><li>Your face shape - if you have a round face, you may want to go slightly longer to create the illusion of length</li><li>Your hair texture - if you have fine hair, you may want to go shorter for more volume; if you have thick hair, you may want to go longer for easier maintenance</li><li>Your personal style - if you prefer an edgier look, you may want to go shorter; if you prefer a more classic look, you may want to go slightly longer</li></ul><h3 id="section2">Tools You'll Need</h3><p>To cut a very short pixie haircut, you'll need a few basic tools:</p><ul><li>Scissors - sharp, high-quality scissors are essential for a clean cut</li><li>Clippers - if you're going very short on the sides and back, clippers can help speed up the process</li><li>Comb - a fine-toothed comb is useful for sectioning and smoothing hair</li><li>Sectioning clips - these can help keep hair out of the way while you're cutting</li><li>Water spray bottle - this can help keep hair damp and easier to cut</li></ul><h3 id="section3">Preparing Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, you'll need to prepare your hair. This means washing and drying it, and combing it out to remove any tangles. If you have curly or wavy hair, you may want to straighten it with a flat iron before cutting, as this can make it easier to see the length and shape of your cut.</p><p>Once your hair is dry and styled, you can start sectioning it. Use clips to divide your hair into four sections: one on top, one on each side, and one at the back. This will make it easier to cut each section separately.</p><h3 id="section4">Cutting the Sides</h3><p>Start by cutting the sides and back of your hair. If you're using clippers, use a number 2 or 3 guard to go over the entire area. If you're using scissors, start at the bottom and work your way up, cutting small sections at a time. Use the comb to hold hair in place and cut straight across.</p><p>When you're cutting the sides, be sure to angle the scissors slightly downward, as this will create a more flattering shape. You can also use the comb to create a slight graduation, so the hair is slightly longer at the top of the sideburns and shorter at the hairline.</p><h3 id="section5">Cutting the Top</h3><p>After you've cut the sides and back, it's time to move on to the top of your hair. This is where you can customize your cut to suit your personal style. Use the scissors to cut small sections of hair at a time, holding the hair straight up and cutting straight across.</p><p>You can also create layers by holding the hair at an angle and cutting into it, so the top layers are slightly shorter than the bottom layers. This will create more volume and texture.</p><h3 id="section6">Trimming the Bangs</h3><p>If you have bangs, you'll need to trim them separately. Use the comb to section off your bangs, and hold them straight up. Cut across the hair in a straight line, or use the scissors to create a slight curve. Be sure to cut less than you think you need, as you can always go back and cut more.</p><h3 id="section7">Adding Texture</h3><p>To add texture to your very short pixie haircut, you can use a few different techniques. One option is to use texturizing shears, which have teeth instead of blades. Use these shears to cut into the hair, creating a choppy, textured look.</p><p>You can also use a razor to create texture. Hold the hair at an angle and use the razor to cut into it, creating soft layers and texture.</p><h3 id="section8">Finishing Touches</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your very short pixie haircut, it's time to add the finishing touches. Use the scissors to trim any stray hairs, and check for any uneven spots. You can also use the clippers or scissors to create a clean, straight line along the nape of your neck.</p><p>If you want to add some product to your hair, choose a lightweight gel or pomade that won't weigh it down. Apply a small amount to your fingertips, and work it through your hair to create texture and hold.</p><h3 id="section9">FAQ</h3><p><b>Q: How often do I need to get my very short pixie haircut trimmed?</b></p><p>A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how quickly it starts to look unruly. Generally, you'll need to get it trimmed every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and length.</p><p><b>Q: Can I color my very short pixie haircut?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can color your very short pixie haircut, but be sure to choose a gentle, ammonia-free formula that won't damage your hair. You may also want to visit a professional stylist for best results.</p><h3 id="section10">Hair Care Tips</h3><p>To keep your very short pixie haircut looking its best, follow these hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days with a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons, as these can damage your hair</li><li>Use a lightweight leave-in conditioner to keep your hair hydrated and healthy</li><li>Avoid using heavy styling products, as these can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy</li><li>Visit your stylist regularly for trims and touch-ups</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to cut a very short pixie haircut, you can try this trendy and edgy style for yourself. With the right tools and techniques, you can create a customized, low-maintenance look that suits your face shape and personal style. Good luck!</p></article>
