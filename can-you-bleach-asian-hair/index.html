Asian hair is thicker and coarser, and it has more melanin than other hair types. This means that it requires more time and effort to bleach Asian hair. The process of bleaching Asian hair involves removing the melanin from the hair shaft, which can be a complex chemical process that requires skill and experience. </p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Bleaching Asian Hair</h3><p>Before you start the bleaching process, you should prepare your hair.

Cheap products may not work as well and can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a lower volume developer for longer periods of time, rather than a higher volume developer for a shorter period of time. This will minimize the risk of damage to your hair.</li><li>Avoid bleaching your hair if it is already damaged or if you have recently colored it.
