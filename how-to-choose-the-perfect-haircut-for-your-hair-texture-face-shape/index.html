There are three main hair textures: fine, medium, and thick. </p><p>If you have fine hair, you should choose a haircut that adds volume and texture. A layered cut is a great option as it adds movement and dimension to your hair. Avoid heavy bangs or blunt cuts as they can make your hair look even thinner. </p><p>If you have medium hair, you have more options when it comes to haircuts. You can go for a layered cut or a blunt cut depending on your preference. A medium length haircut can look great on you, as well as a shoulder-length bob. </p><p>If you have thick hair, you should choose a haircut that thins out your hair and reduces bulk. A layered cut is a great option as it removes weight from your hair. Avoid blunt cuts as they can make your hair look even thicker. </p><h2 id="face-shape">Face Shape</h2><p>Your face shape is another important factor to consider when choosing a haircut. There are six main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and long. </p><p>If you have an oval face shape, you're lucky as most haircuts will look great on you! You can go for a pixie cut, a bob, a layered cut, or even long hair. </p><p>If you have a round face shape, you should choose a haircut that adds length and angles to your face. A long bob or a shoulder-length cut with layers can look great on you. Avoid blunt cuts or heavy bangs as they can make your face look even rounder. </p><p>If you have a square face shape, you should choose a haircut that softens your features. A layered cut with soft waves can look great on you, as well as a long bob with side-swept bangs. Avoid blunt cuts or straight hairstyles as they can make your face look too angular. </p><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, you should choose a haircut that balances your features. A layered bob or a long bob with side-swept bangs can look great on you. Avoid heavy bangs or short haircuts as they can make your forehead look even wider. </p><p>If you have a diamond face shape, you should choose a haircut that adds width to your forehead and chin. A layered cut with soft waves can look great on you, as well as a long bob with side-swept bangs. Avoid heavy bangs or blunt cuts as they can make your face look too narrow. </p><p>If you have a long face shape, you should choose a haircut that adds width to your face. A layered cut with soft waves can look great on you, as well as a long bob with side-swept bangs. Avoid long, straight hairstyles or heavy bangs as they can make your face look even longer. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Perfect Haircut</h2><p>Now that you know your hair texture and face shape, it's time to choose the perfect haircut.
